\section{A changing world} 

% Ideas a desarrollar:

% * Un mundo en constante evolución.
% * Cambio climático
% * Transición energética global
% * Cambios sociales/políticos.
% * Migraciones

%Se dice que nada es permanente excepto el cambio. Nos encontramos en un mundo en constante evolución donde inevitablemente algunos de los cambios que nos acontecen nos sobrepasarán sin que seamos capaces de adaptarnos a ellos. Mientras, otros pasarán desapercibidos a nuestros ojos por su lentitud o por no encontrarse en el centro de nuestras preocupaciones. Resulta paradójico pensar que algunos de esos cambios provocados por el ser humano, consciente o incoscientemente, con voluntad o por equivocación, obligarán al mismo como espcecie a resistir y adaptarse frente a las consecuencias de aquello que ellos mismos generaron. 

It is said that nothing is permanent except for change. We are in a constantly evolving world where, unavoidably, some of these changes will go over us without us  being able to adapt to them. Meanwhile, other changes will go unnoticed because of their slowness or because they are not part of our main concerns. It seems paradox to think that some of those human induced changes, consciously or unconsciously, willingly or by mistake, will make human beings resist an get adapted as a species against the consequences of something that they themselves created. 

%El desarrollo y la evolución de los pueblos ha estado ligado desde la primera Revolución Industrial a un incremento en la demanda de energía. El uso de los combustibles fósiles desde la invención de la máquina de vapor ha cambiado la forma de vida de las sociedades. Asociadas a este crecimiento, las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero y su concentración en la atmósfera se han disparado con respecto a la época pre-Industrial [ref]. El calentamiento global, con su origen en las actividades humanas, supone uno de los mayores retos de adaptación para el ser humano. El carácter anisotrópico de los impactos asociados al cambio climático pone a prueba la solidaridad con las comunidades más vulnerables y menos responsables en este dilema.[ref]

The evolution and development of nations has been linked since the first Industrial Revolution to an increment on the energy demand. The use of fossil fuels since the vapour engine has changed the well-being of societies. Related to this increase, the green house gasses (GHG) emissions and their concentration in the atmosphere has risen dramatically in contrast to pre-Industrial times. Global warming, with its origin in human activities, is one of the biggest challenges of adaptation for human beings. The \textit{anisotropic} character of the associated impacts of climate change puts our solidarity with the most vulnerable and less responsible communities on trial.

%Para algunos estamos sumergidos en lo que ha sido descrito como una Tercera Revolución Industrial (ref), un proceso de desarrollo científico-tecnológico exponencial, donde convergen el desarrollo de las tecnologías renovables con el uso masivo de las nuevas tecnologías de la comunicación. La transición energética en marcha debería ser la respuesta a una demanda de una ciudadanía comprometida que encuentra en estas tecnologías una alternativa y una respuesta a los problemas medioambientales y sus consecuencias asociadas. 

Some people believe we are in what has been described as the Third Industrial Revolution (ref), a process of exponential scientific-technological development, characterised as a convergence of the evolution of renewable energy technologies and the massive use of new communication technologies. The ongoing energy transition should be the answer to committed citizens that find those technologies as an alternative and an answer to the environmental challenges and associated consequences.     

%El contexto actual está caracterizado por una avanzada globalización donde se han difuminado las fronteras gracias al desarrollo de las telecomunicaciones y los movimientos migratorios internacionales son más factibles [ref]. En 2015, había 100 millons más de personas residiendo en un país diferente al de su nacimiento que en 1990 [International Organization for Migration]. La mayoría de éstos movimientos están relacionados con oportunidades laborales o cuestiones familiares. Sin embargo, el crecimiento de la población y el aumento indefinido de la demanda de recursos para sustentar un sistema basado en el crecimiento continuo provoca conflictos geopolíticos y el agotamiento de estos recursos naturales [ref], lo que desemboca en el aumento de movimientos migratorios de distinto carácter. Las poblaciones migran huyendo de las zonas de conflicto o de las áreas más afectadas por desastres naturales [ref ``Environmental Migration Portal'', ref ``International Organization for Migration'']. En este sentido, éstos movimientos afectan a los más vulnerables y requieren especial atención.

The actual context is characterised by an advanced globalisation where the borders have been blurred through telecommunications development and international migration movements are becoming more feasible [ref]. In 2015, there were 100 millions more people living in a different country of its birth country than in 1990 [International Organisation for Migration]. Most of that movements are related to work opportunities or family issues. However, the increase of the population and the rising demand of natural resources to support a system based on the continuous growth lead to geopolitic conflicts and the depletion of natural resources, what supposes an increase in migration movements of different character. Populations migrate away from conflict areas or most affected areas by natural disasters [ref ``Environmental Migration Portal'', ref ``International Organisation for Migration'']. In that sense, these movements affect most vulnerable people and require special attention.

%Para poder abordar las necesidades humanas esta coyuntura de crecimiento de población, aumento de la demanda energética y crisis medioambiental, es necesario un cambio de paradigma. Este cambio debe pasar por reconocer la interdependencia entre la humanidad y los distintos ecosistemas y seres vivos, así como reconocerla importancia intrínseca de la naturaleza en sí misma. En 1962 Thomas Khun en su obra ``La Estructura de las Revoluciones Científicas'' escribió que un cambio de paradigma no ocurre realmente hasta que sus adheridos son reemplazados por una nueva generación. Habrá por lo tanto que esperar para ver el desenlace de este cambio de paradigma, esperando que no sea demasiado tarde.

In order to address the human needs in a juncture of population growth, increase of energy demand and environmental crisis, a paradigm shift is needed. This change would mean recognising our interdependence with every ecosystem and all living beings as well as recognising the importance of nature itself. In 1962, Thomas Kuhn wrote in his book  "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" that a paradigm shift does not occur until the adherents of the old paradigm are replaced with the new generation. We should then wait to see the end of this paradigm shift hoping that it is not too late. 


%* Entrelazamiento de todas estas cuestiones.
%* El conocimiento puro + el conocimiento aplicado: obligación de la ciencia a ser en la medida de lo posible aplicada a solucionar problemas de las distintas sociedades. Justicia social. Más si estos problemas han sido creados por el ser humano.


%Applied science has made societies evolved through the link between the basic science and the implementation of this structural knowdlege to the individual dailylife. The bridge between the fundamental studies and its evolution or transformation into something applied (useful) for the societies development is been a matter of interpretation or 'translation' (so interpreters/translator) to find the accurate language to exchange this knowdlege.

% Esta transversalidad entre las disciplinas básicas de la física, la química o la biología con distintas acepciones prácticas, la mayoría de ellas recogidas bajo el paraguas de las ingenierías, desemboca ineludiblemente en una transformación de lo abstracto en lo tangible con la premisa o el ideal de mejorar el bienestar de las sociedades presentes y futuras.

%Transversality between the fundamental disciplines of physiscs, chemistry or biology and their different applied branches, most of them under the umbrella of engenieering, end unavoidably into a transformation from the abstraction to the tanglible with the premise or ideal of improving wellbeing of present and future societies.

% Es sin embargo muy probable, que esta concepción de la aplicación científica haya desembocado en el mayor problema al que la humanidad tiene que hacer frente desde su existencia, el cambio climático. Siendo este antropocentrismo parte del problema, y no de la solución. Jorge Wasenberg escibe en su libro, ``el pensador intruso'' en referencia a la evolución de la ciencia y el progreso subyacente lo siguiente:

% Nevertheless, it is very likely that this conception of the scientific application had lead to the most challeging problem that humanity has to face from its existance, climate change, being this anthropocentrism part of the problem and not of the solution.

%In his book ``El pensador intruso'', Jorge Wasengber wrote about the evolution of science and the underlying progress what follows: 

%'There are above all two vices that tend to set 'pre-cooked' ideollogy into science. First is base on different kinds of anthropocentrism and consist in put the knowdlege subjet into the cosmos's center. The history of knowdlege is the witness: each time we 'barremos' the 'I' from the spot, the knowdlege progresses and only because of it.'
% ``Existen sobre todo dos vicios que tienden a inyectar ideología precocinada en la ciencia. Una de ellas se basa en las distintas formas de antropocentrismo y consiste en situar instintivamente al sujeto del conocimiento en el centro del cosmos. La historia del conocimiento es testigo: cada vez que barremos el Yo del centro del escenario el conocimiento avanza, y avanza sólo por ello.''

% Sin caer en lo pretencioso, este trabajo contribuye a la imbricación entre la ciencia del cambio climático y la tecnología renovable de producción eléctrica con mayor potencial a día de hoy, la solar fotovoltaica.

\section{Renewable Energy}

%\subsection{Concept of energy}

% The physics concept of \textbf{energy} is defined as the capacity of a system to perform a work and it is divided into two groups: kinetic energy, that is related to the movement of the system, and the potential energy, related to its position. For this fundamental classification, mechanical energy, electromagnetic and thermal energy are encompassed in the kinetic energy group, while the chemical energy or the gravitational potential energy, as it is the case of hydropower,  are inside the potential energy group.
 
% \subsection{Types and classification}

% It is elementary to delimit the differences between kinds and sources of energy. Sources of energy are defined as those from which useful energy can be extracted, and directly applied to its purpose (being this one movement, electricity production or metabolic processes) or by undergoing any transformation process.

In the context of energetic consumption of our societies, we will call \textbf{primary energy sources} those from which we would obtain the final energy, after a process of extraction or transformation and transport. Regarding that, we consider fossil fuels primary energy, hydro-power, solar energy or biomass. These sources of primary energy provide the final energy that many times will be in the form of electricity. 

These primary energy sources can be classified depending on their origin, being \textbf{renewable} those ones that are inexhaustible. The sun, despite of its unquestionable finitude is considered inexhaustible as well, because of the difference in the temporal scale of  human existence and the life of such star, which is lots of magnitude orders above.

\subsection{History and evolution}

%El uso de la energía renovable ha acompañado el desarrollo de la humanidad desde tiempos remotos. Desde la utilización de la biomasa para generar energía térmica para calentarse, hasta la transformación de la energía eólica en energía mecánica en los molinos tradicionales o en la navegación. Solo hacia la mitad del siglo 19, con la invención de la máquina de vapor, comenzó la utilización de los combustibles fósiles de manera masiva y con ello lo que se denominó la Revolución Industrial. Este periodo supuso un gran desarrollo en términos tecnológicos así como en la evolución del bienestar de las sociedades, al menos de aquellas que hemos llamado, occidentales.

The use of renewable energy has come along the development of humanity since ancient times. From the use of biomass to get thermal energy, to the transformation of wind energy in mechanical energy in the traditional windmills or in shipping. It was around the middle of the 19Th century with the invention of the vapour engine that fossil fuels started to be used massively and linked to that, the so called First Industrial Revolution. This period meant a big technological development as well as the evolution of well being of societies, at least to those from the richest or western countries.

%Sin embargo, este desarrollo trajo asociado un aumento de la demanda de combustibles fósiles que ha crecido de manera explonencial, durante el siglo 20y ha generado numerosos conflictos. Las sociedades cada vez más demandantes de energía han crecido a espaldas de la realidad de sustentar su desarrollo en recursos finitos y distribuidos de manera desigual en la Tierra.

However, this development brought about an increase of the demand on fossil fuels that grew up exponentially during the 20Th century. Societies were more and more dependent on energy and have evolved turning a blind eye to the reality that the base of their development are finite resources unequally distributed around the globe.

%El primer impulso para diversificar las fuentes de energía primaria no tuvo lugar hasta los años 70, con la primera crisis del petróleo [ref]. El embargo de los países productores de petróleo tuvo grandes consecuencias económicas en los países importadores, lo que provocó que algunos comenzaran a considerar nuevas formas de energía para asegurar su estabilidad y abastecimiento.

The first step to diversify sources of primary energy did not take place until the 70's, with the first petroleum crisis \cite*{Sorensen1991}. The embargo on the petroleum producer countries had some important economic consequences on the importer ones, some of whom started to consider new sources of energy in order to ensure stability and supply.


%En las últimas décadas, además de factores socioeconómicos y geopolíticos que han llevado a la necesidad de limitar la dependencia del petróleo en los países importadores, el impulso para el crecimiento exponencial de estas tecnologías alternativas, ha venido provocado por el gran descenso en sus costes, que tiene su origen sobre todo en el fomento de políticas ``verdes'' impulsadas por distintos organismos y gobiernos [IPCC] y que han generado un círculo virtuoso alrededor de estas tecnologías. El descenso en los costes gracias a las políticas de support y con visión a largo plazo, ha favorecido, a su vez, una mayor implantación de objetivos nacionales en la instalación de plantas de generación renovable para combatir el cambio climático. En 2017 más de 170 países habían establecido objetivos de generación renovable (IRENA 2017).

In the last decades, in addition to the socio-economic and geopolitic factors that have led to the need of limiting petroleum dependence in importer countries, the stimulus for the big increase of these alternative technologies, has come about due to their decreasing costs, which have the origin in the promotion of support policies. These policies have been driven by different organisms and governments [IPCC] and have created a virtuous cycle around these technologies. The decrease in costs thanks to the support and long-term view policies, favours at the same time more national target commitments in the installation of renewable power plants to fight against Climate Change. In 2017 more than 170 countries had established goals of renewable generation (IRENA2017)

%En 2018 las energías renovables ya suponen un $55\%$ de la energía final consumida según un informe de REN21, con un porcentaje del $27\%$ en generación de calor y un $25\%$ de electricidad. El transporte, en cambio, sigue siendo el sector con menor porcentaje de renovables con sólo un $3\%$. 

In 2018 renewable energies are the 55$\%$ of the final energy consumption according to the REN21 report [ref], with a share of 27$\%$ in heat generation and $25\%$ for electricity. Transport is the sector with less share of renewable energy with only a $3\%$.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Algunas estadísticas más sobre renovables  
% \item Remarcar el crecimiento de la fotovoltaica
% \item Terminar con: los escenarios futuros estarán determinados principalmente por 3 factores: un aumento en la demanda dada sobre todo por los países en desarrollo, una mayor electrificación y un descenso en el consumo de los combustibles fósiles.  
% \end{itemize}


\section{Photovoltaic Energy}

% Photovoltaic energy is based in the conversion of incident solar energy into electricity. This process is made by the photovoltaic systems whose basic unit that transform solar radiation intro electricity is the \textbf{solar cell.}

% \subsection{P-N junction}


% The fundamental physics of a solar cell is based in the \textbf{P-N junction}: a device that put in contact an extrinsic semiconductor, also called doped semiconductor, of type P and N.

% A N-type semiconductor is the one that has been doped with impurities: impurities are atoms with a higher number of valence electrons that the original semiconductor. Due to that, there is an excess of electrons, or negative charge carriers, in a cristal N-type. Once the new atom is icluded in the net, the extra-electrons goes to the conduction band of the semiconductor, remaining the associated positive charge in the net. This positive charge is called ``hole''. In a N-type semiconductor the concentration of electrons is bigger than the concentration of holes, what makes them the majority charge carrier. 

% In a P-type semiconductor the doping process consists in the addition to the net of some atoms with an smaller number of electrons than the original semiconductor. The holes density is then higher than the density of electrons.

% The P-N juntion put in contact the two semiconductors \ref{fig:pn}, which oringinates an imbalance due to the difference in concentration of charge carriers. That difference in the density starts a difsusion process from one side to another of the union, consisting in a movement of holes to the 'n' side through the valence band and a movement of the carriers of type 'p' to the opposite side (throught the conduction band). If carriers were not electrically charged, the diffusion process would continue until equilibrium. Due to their electrical charge, the ions linked to the net generates an electric field that oposse to the carriers diffusion. Then, it reaches the balance when the processes of diffusion and are equal.

% \begin{figure}[h!]
% \centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/unionpn.pdf}
% \caption{PN junction, b) PN forward bias}
% \label{fig:pn}
% \end{figure}


% When the equilibrium is reached, the closer region to the interface called \textbf{space charge region}, the minority carriers are recombined and there are only electrically charged ions linked to the net. The electric field created by the ions generates a potential difference called, thermodinamical potential, that avoid the mjoroty carriers to cross to the other side f the juntion.

% \subsection{P-N forward bias}

% If we want to make a current to cross the P-N junction it is necessary to break the balance and that means that you need to reduce the thermodinamical potential. In order to do that, we can apply a potential difference between the edges of each semicunductor. If the P side has a positive voltage with respect to the N side, the PN junction is forward bias and reverse in the other case. In the forward biases the potential barrier is reduced and then electric charge cannot compensate the diffusion. The carriers of each side can go through the charge area and reach the other side, where they are minority carriers. At this moment the diffusion process creates two currents with two opposite directions, so they do not compensate each other and it generates an usable current. 

% If the P-N junction is reverse biases, which means that the P side has a negative voltage, the potential barrier increases and there will not be an usable current.

% Los procesos de generación de corriente en la unión P-N pueden resumirse en la ecuación de Shockley \ref{eq:shockley} que define la corriente generada por un diodo. El diodo es el dispositivo electrónico que se basa en el funcionamiento teórico de la unión P-N. En \ref{eq:shockley} $I_0$ es la corriente de saturación del diodo en oscuridad, $V$ la tensión aplicada y $m$ un factor para ajustar al funcionamiento real y $V_T$ el potencial térmico.

% The processes of current generation in the P-N junction can be summarized in the Shockley equation \ref{eq:shockley} that defines the current generated in a diode, an electronic deviced based in the P-N functioning. In \ref{eq:shockley} $I_0$  is the saturation current, $V$ the voltage applied and $m$ is a factor to adjust to real behaviour and $V_T$ is the thermodinamical potential.


% \begin{equation}
%   I_{D}=I_0\cdot [e^{{V}\over {m\cdot {V_{T}}}}-1]
% \label{eq:shockley}
% \end{equation}

% \subsection{Solar Cell}

% When the P-N junction is iluminated, the incident energy can be absorbed by the electrons in the semiconductor that can jump into the conduction band, due to the photoelectric effect. Charge carriers are produced in this process because a pair electron-hole is created, this pair of carriers is then conducted due to the electric field of the junction creating a current.  

% The equation \ref{eq:Isolar} determine the generated current by an iluminated solar cell.

% \begin{equation}
%   I=I_L - I_0\cdot [e^{{V}\over {m\cdot {V_{T}}}}-1]
% \label{eq:Isolar}
% \end{equation}


% The generated phtotocurrent will depend in the first place on the energy of the incident ligth. If its frequency is not high enough, the ligth will not be able to break bonds and it will go trough the cristal without being absorbed. Due to that not all the ligth can be usable to generate current and it will exist some loses of transmission, reflection and recombination of some of the carriers.

% The equivalent equation of solar cell that makes possible to model its behaviour is based on a current generator and a diode. It can be described by the next equation:

% \begin{equation}
%   I=I_{sc}[1-exp({\frac{V-V_{oc}+I\cdot R_s}{m\cdot V_T}})
% \label{eq:Ieq}
% \end{equation}

% Where $I_{sc}$ is the \textit{short-circuit} current, obtain when the voltage applied to the junction is 0:

% \begin{equation}
%   I_{sc}=I(V=0)=I_L
% \label{eq:Isc}
% \end{equation}

% In addition, if we apply the condition of \textit{open circuit} to the solar cell equation (I=0):

% \begin{equation}
%   V_{oc}=V(I=0)=m\cdot {\frac{k\cdot T_c}{e}}\cdot ln({\frac{I_L}{I_0}}+1)
% \label{eq:Voc}
% \end{equation}

% Finally $R_s$ in \ref{eq:Ieq} represents the resistance due to semiconductor material and the metallic contacs.

\section{Links between climate and renewable energy}

%El sector energético en general y las tecnologías renovables en particular son altamente dependientes del estado de la atmósfera. La cantidad de recurso disponible en cada momento determinará, no sólo la energía final que podemos generar con las distintas tecnologías (eólica, fotovoltaica etc.), sino en muchos casos, afectará a la demanda eléctrica en situaciones meorológicas de (por ejemplo) olas de frío o extremo calor. Por ello el mercado energético y los diferentes agentes del sector, así como la necesidad de que la generación y la demanda eléctrica estén balanceadas en todo momento, necesitan de información meteorológica de alta calidad y resolución. Con ello será posible establecer y predecir la cantidad de energía que se puede generar con cada tecnología renovable. 

The energy sector in general but particularlly the renewable energy technologies are highly dependent on the state of the atmosphere. The amount of resource available at each time determine, not only the final energy that can be generated with different technologies, but also, it affects the electricity demand in some extreme meteorological events like heatwaves or cold spells. Due to that, energy market and different stakeholders, as well as the need of keep balance between generation and supply, demand an accurate and high resolution meteorological information. Thanks to that, it is possible to forecast the amount of energy that can be generated with each technology. 

%Por otro lado, las condiciones meteorológicas afectan de manera indirecta en otros muchos aspectos. Por ejemplo, el mantenimiento de un parque éolico offshore es un proceso extremadamente complejo debido a la accesibilidad de los aerogeneradores. Conocer de antemano la predicción meteorológica es necesario para planificar y evitar poner en riesgo a las personas implicadas.  

On the other hand, meteorological conditions affect indirectly in other aspects. For instance, the maintenance operation in an offshore wind farm is an extreme complex process due to the accessibility of the wind turbines. It is very important to know beforehand the weather forecast in order to plan the activities and avoid the risk exposure of the employees.

%Aunque las fases de operación o mantenimiento en las plantas de generación eléctrica constituyen uno de los núcleos más importantes del proyecto, es necesario considerar también algunas etapas que requieren de escalas temporales más largas. En primer lugar, para poder establecer la idoneidad de una planta de generación renovable, se establece una fase de evaluación del recurso o evaluación del potencial. En este periodo, se analizarán series temporales largas que sean representativas del recurso disponible en una zona. Esta etapa permite a los promotores establecer la energía máxima disponible que serán capaces de vender en el mercado eléctrico y será necesaria para poder establecer una financiación adecuada.

Although the short-term activities are in the core of the operational side of a renewable energy project, it is worth it to consider some stages that requires the study of longer temporal scales. Firstly, in order to establish the suitability of a renewable power plant, it is necessary to develop a resource assessment phase or potential assessment phase. This allows the owners to estimate the maximum power output of a project depending on the meteorological conditions and assess the amount of energy that they will be able to produce, what becomes important in order to finance the project.  


%En el contexto actual de calentamiento global, la relación entre energía y clima ha estado ligada habitualmente al impacto que una mayor participación de las renovables en el mix de generación puede provocar en él, considerando la posible reducción de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero de origen antopogénico por esta vía. Sin embargo, el hecho de que el cambio en el clima puede a su vez provocar un cambio en la disponibilidad o distribución de los recursos renovables, así como en los patrones de demanda eléctrica, debe ser investigado en profundidad. [JRC report:Climate modelling and renewable energy resource assessment].

In a global warming context, the link between energy and climate has been usually related to the impact that a big share of renewable in the generation mix can cause regarding the possible reduction of GHG in this way. However, the fact that climate change can cause at the same time variation in the availability or distribution of the resources, as well as in the electricity demand patterns, should be taken into account and thoroughly researched. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/esquema.pdf}
\caption{Scheme: }
\label{fig:feedback}
\end{figure}

%Debido a las características intrínsecas de los recursos renovables relacionadas con su alta variablidad espacio-temporal, el sector energético demanda análisis y conocimiento profundo acerca de éstas caracteríticas en distintas escalas temporales. Esto, ayudaría a una mayor integración de las mismas así como a la mejora en la planifición, poniendo cada vez más relevancia en las escalas climáticas.

Due to the intrinsic characteristics of renewable energy resources, related to their high space-time variability, the energy sector demands analysis and deep knowledge about that features in different time-scales. That would help to a greater integration of renewable energies as well as to an improvement in the plannification, taking more and more attention into climatic scales.

%En la figura... están representados diversos eventos meteorológicos y climatológicos que afectan a la generación energética. El eje 'x' representa las distintas escalas temporales en las que ocurren estos eventos. Es interesante destacar, aunque no es el tema principal de esta investigación, la relevancia de la escala estacional y sub-estacional para la operación de las plantas energéticas de tipo renovable. La mejora en la predicción climática en estas escalas repercutirá de forma directa en la planificación de la operación y mantenimiento, así como ayuda en la gestión por parte del operador de red y mercado. Por ejemplo, conocer con antelación si un otoño va a ser especialmente lluvioso, sirve para predecir la cantidad de electricidad que se puede producir con las centrales hidroeléctricas, haciendo el sistema mucho más eficiente y fiable. 

It is important to say, although it is out of the scope of this thesis, the relevance of the seasonal and sub-seasonal scale (and models) for the operation and maintenance of power plants. The improvement in the climate forecast on that scales will impact directly on their activities and will help to the TSO and market opeartor in the management activities. For instance, to know in advance if the next Autumn is going to be specially rainy, will help to assess the amount of electricity the can be produced with hydro-power plants, making the system more reliable and efficient.

%Uno de los problemas asociados al posible cambio en el medio-largo plazo de los recursos renovables, como puede ser el eólico, es la posible pérdida de rentabilidad de algunos proyectos que actualmente se encuentran en fase final de su vida. La repotenciación de estos proyectos con tecnologías más actualizadas, como puede ser la sustitución por turbinas eólicas de mayor potencia, junto con la prolongación de las concesiones de explotación del proyecto [ref] son una de las opciones que se dan en aquellas plantas de generación que se instalaron hace casi dos décadas. Los cambios en el recurso pueden cambiar las condiciones del proyecto no sólo por la modernización de la maquinaria y tecnología empleada, sino por el recurso disponible en la misma zona.

One of the associated problems to the possible medium to long-term changes on the renewable resources, like the wind patterns, is the possibility of profitability loss of some projects that are now in the final stage of its lifetime. Re-powering of these projects with upgraded technology, like the replace of old wind turbines by new ones with larger nameplate capacity or more efficient, is one of the options for the power plants installed almost two decades ago [ref]. Changes in the resource can change the conditions of the project not only because of the turbines used but also because of the availability of the resource.  
 
%La bancabilidad[ref] de un proyecto renovable depende de dos factores: en primer lugar su recurso y en segundo lugar, sus beneficios. Los beneficios obtenidos por el proyecto renovable dependerán del periodo de operación y de la cantidad de energía suministrada en este tiempo. Por ello, una evaluación adecuada, no sólo del recurso disponible a lo largo de todo el proyecto, sino de su variabilidad y de las posibles tendencias, es necesario a lo largo del ciclo de vida de la planta, que puede alargarse hasta 30 años[ref].

Bankabilkity [ref] of a project depends on two main factors: in first place the availability of the resource and in the second place the benefits obtained from the project. Benefits depends on the operation time and the amount of energy supplied during the lifetime of the project. Due to that, an accurate assessment, not only of the available resource, but also of its variability and trends, is necessary.

\subsection{Climate services}

%Con la creciente demanda de información por parte del sector energético de predicciones y proyecciones climáticas, aparece de manera natural la creación de los servicios climáticos para sistematizar, de alguna manera la información necesaria para los distintos stakeholders. 

With the increasing demand from the energy sector of predictions and climate projections comes naturally the climate services development, in order to systematise, to organise and to target the information for different stakeholders. [ref]

%Como puede observarse en la figure \ref{fig:feedback}, los procesos de interacción entre la sociedad y las variables involucradas en la generación de energía son de doble sentido. Por un lado el abastecimiento dependerá de la disponibilidad de los recursos y por otro, la demanda está directamente influenciada por estos factores climáticos. Teniendo en cuenta esto, el desarrollo de los servicios climáticos debe basar la mejora de sus modelos y por lo tanto, de los productos ofrecidos en estas dos premisas.

As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:feedback}, interaction processes between society and the variables involve in the energy generation are ``de doble sentido''. On one hand, the energy supply would depend on the availability of the resources and on the other hand, demand is directly influenced by those factors. Due to that, development of climate services should be base on the improvement of the models and the offered products considering the two sides.   

%La información climática en el sector energético es especialmente relevante para las descisiones estratégicas y la evaluación de riego, las operaciones de trading o la planficación de la operación y el mantenimiento en las plantas de generación (especialmente) renovables.

Climate information is specially relevant for strategic decisions, evaluation risks, planning and trading operations.

%Es relevante, aunque no es el tema de esta tesis, decir que también otros tipos de generación no renovable pueden beneficiarse de esta información y estar afectados de manera importante por algunos eventos climáticos. Por ejemplo, el aumento de temperatura del aire puede provocar una subida en la temperatura de los ríos, que ocasionalmente repercute en la operación de las plantas nucleares. En estos casos, estas plantas se ven afectadas porque no pueden continuar on las operaciones de refrigeración de los reactores (ref). 

It is relevant to say that conventional power plants can get profit of the climate services information. Some of them can easily be impacted by some extreme events like heatwaves. The above normal increase of air temperature in a heatwave episode can be related to the increase in the temperature of the river flow. That increase eventually affect the nuclear power plants operations, because the impacted plants are not able to use the river for their refrigeration purposes [ref].

%El sistema climático ha variado continuamente y de manera significativa a lo largo de la historia de la Tierra. Las variaciones del clima puede explicarse debido a factores o forzamientos externos y la respuesta del sistema climático a los mismos o, por otro lado, puede ser la causa de inestabilidades internas y relaciones no lineales entre los distintos componentes del sistema.

Climate system has varied constantly and significantly along the Earth history. Climate variability can be explained due to external factors and the response of climate system to them or on the other hand, it can be due to the internal instabilities and non-linear relationship between different components of the system, the last ones occur independently of the external forcings.

%Los distintos forzamientos de origen externo pueden ser factores astronómicos, como los cambios en la intensidad de la radiación solar o en los parámetros orbitales, o bien, factores terrestres como la composición de la atmósfera debido a la actividad humana, cambios en la superficie terrestre debido al uso de la misma etc.

Different external forcings can be astronomic factors, like changes on the intensity of solar radiation or in the orbital parameters, or they can be terrestrial factors like changes in the composition of the atmosphere due to human activity, changes in the earth surface due to land use etc.

%Algunas variaciones del sistema climático ocurren de manera independiente de los forzamientos externos. Estas variaciones tienen su origen en las distintas interacciones no lineales entre los componentes del sistema climático y dan como resultado la variabilidad natural del sistema climático. 

%Some variations of the climate system happen independently of the external forcings. These variations have their origin on different no-linear interactions between different components of climate system and the result is the natural variability of the climate system.

%Desde la revolución industrial la Tierra ha experimentado un aumento de la temperatura global que no es posible explicar mediante los forzamientos externos 'naturales'  del clima como cambios en la actividad solar o en las emisiones volcánicas (Bindoff et al, 2013), ni forma parte de la variabilidad natural del sistema. El IPCC en su último informe, asegura que la actividad humana y en concreto las emisiones de efecto invernadero generadas desde la Revolución Industrial (1850) son responsables del cambio climático que ha generado el ascenso de temperatura global y que ha hecho que probablemente los 30 años entre 1983-2012 hayan sido los más cálidos en los últimos 1400 años en el hemisferio norte (IPCC). A pesar de la marcada variabilidad interanual (Stocker et al. 2013), el aumento de temperatura con caracter global en las últimas décadas es evidente. [ref de observaciones globales]

Since the Industrial Revolution the Earth has experimented an increase in the global temperature that cannot be explained due to natural external forcings like changes on solar activity or volcanic emissions (Bindoff et al, 2013), either it cannot be explained as part of the internal variability of the system. The IPCC in its last report, assure that human activity and more precisely, GHG emissions generated since 1850 are responsible of the climate change that causes the increase in global temperature and has made that probably the last 30 years between 1983-2012 have been the warmer in the last 1400 years in the northern hemisphere (IPCC). In spite of the large interannual variability (Stocker et al 2013), the global character of the temperature increase in last decades is clear.[ref de observaciones globales].

%Las consecuencias del aumento de temperatura desde un punto de vista físico dependen de la sensibilidad del sistema a los cambios en la concentración de gases de efecto invernadero. Son numerosos los estudios [ref] que se han realizado para intentar cuantificar el impacto que este aumento de temperatura puede tener en los distintos subsistemas a través de los diferentes mecanísmos de retroalimentación que pueden generarse.

%A pesar de la característica global del cambio climático, sus consecuencias e impactos son percibidos a escala local y regional. Estos impactos afectan a comunidades y poblaciones de manera desigual dependiendo de su capacidad de adaptación y resilencia. Por ello, la respuesta desde un punto de vista socio-económico para mitigar estos efectos, tiene que venir dada en esta escala, aunque exista consenso sobre la urgencia de actuación y se adopten compromisos comunes.

Despite of the fact that climate change is global concept, its consequences and impacts are perceived in a local and regional scale. These impacts affect communities and population unequally depending on its adaptation capabilities and resilience. Due to that, the socio-economic response to mitigate climate change impacts has to be applied in that scale although it should be a consensus on the urgency and some common compromises have to be adopted.

%Uno de los primeros trabajos que intentaba cuantificar el impacto del cambio climático a escala local fue el de Giorgi et. al 2006. En este trabajo, se utilizaba por primera vez un índice (RCCI) para medir de forma cuantitativa y compara geográficamente las zonas más afectadas por el CC. En este aspecto, el trabajo estaba enfocado desde un punto de vista climático, es decir, el índice mide la sensibilidad del clima en esa zona. En este sentido, el Mediterráneo aparecía como una de las zonas más afectadas y desde entonces ha sido denominado como un hot-spot de CC.

One of the first works on quantification of climate change impacts in a regional scale was the one published by Giorgi et. al in 2006. They used for the first time an index, RCCI, that measured and compare geographically the climate sensitivity of different areas to climate change. The conclusion of the research showed that the Mediterranean area was the most affected area in terms of climate response to climate change, and since then it has been refered to as a climate change hot-spot.

%Los ensembles de modelos climáticos proyectan escenarios en los que las principales consecuencias del calentamiento global en el área Mediterránea son un descenso generalizado de las precipitaciones, debido a un aumento de la circulación anticiclónica asociada a un desplazamiento hacia el norte de ``Atlantic storm track''. Las temperaturas proyectadas son inusualmente altas con un ascenso especialmente alto en los meses de verano.

The climate models ensemble projects scenarios in which the main consequences of global warming in the Mediterranean area are a generalised decrease of precipitations (with the exception of some areas like the Alps), due to an increase in the anticyclonic circulation, that is associated with a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track [ref]. Also it is projected an increase in interannual variability of temperature and precipitation, mostly in the warm season [ref]. In terms of extreme events, it is also projected less frequent but more intense precipitation events and with respect of temperature, some authors have evaluated the probability of an increase in heatwaves over the Mediterranean area [ref].

\section{Variable renewable energies: VRE}

The variable nature of renewable energy resources, in space and time, is a key aspect for their high penetration into the conventional electricity systems. Due to the fact that supply and demand have to match at every time-step, the forecast and management of the electricity produced with 'variable renewable energy (VRE)' plants is necessary to accomplish this match. In the traditional electricity systems, a portfolio of centralised power plants (coal, nuclear, gas...) dispatch electricity as customer loads demanded it. The conventional power plants are able to storage the primary energy that they use and only produce electricity when it is needed. With the increase of wind and solar power plants, the supply of electricity demand approach has changed. The VRE power plants only produce electricity when enough resource is available and in the case of photovoltaic power plants, only during the daylight time. This concept has being refered as \textbf{intermittency}, to recall the fact that solar and wind resources are not available at any time and that they are variable in different time-scales. Power plants with intermittency resources a and no-storage are non-dispachable power plants and the operation of the system has to be adapted. However, the alternatives of energy storage from VRE plants are increasing in different ways: batteries for wind and photovoltaic power plants, hydrogen or pumping hydro-power \cite*{Lund2015, Blanco2018, Schaber2004}.

The research in storage for VRE is rising but different approaches are also being adopted to integrate high share of this alternative technologies. The term \textbf{flexibility} is one of the most used refered to the new strategies followed from the demand and supply side in order to adapt to the new system \cite*{KROPOSKI2017}. From the demand side, flexibility refers to means related to load shape and demand patterns, like peak saving, load shifting, valley filling etc \cite*{Lund2015}.

On the other hand, flexibility of the supply side depends on the power plants, whose output can be controled to obtain power balance. It is important in terms of flexibility to consider the response time of different power plants as well as the different nature of each one. As the availability of solar and wind resources are not related to the geographical distribution of the demand, a highly interconnected grid is one of the main needs for high VRE penetration. Once this is considered, geographically spread portfolio of VRE plants are able to smooth variability of power output \cite*{KROPOSKI2017, Marcos2012}(Hoff and Perez 2012, 2013, añadir más referencias).

%* Explicar más el concepto de smoothing?? agregar aquí todas las citas de smoothing

There are also studies that try to identify complementary features of different energy resources either in time or in space in order to address the intermittency issue through the smooth of the total power output. The complementary studies are made using different technologies like hydro-power and wind power \cite*{Denault2009, Silva2016} or hydro-power and solar photovoltaic \cite*{Francois2016, Beluco2012, Kougias2016}. In \cite*{Hoicka2011} complementary of wind and solar is investigated for a region in Canada, also over the Iberian Peninsula \cite*{Santos-Alamillos2012, Jerez2013b} and Great Britain \cite*{Bett2016} in climatological perpectives and local complementary is investigated in Italy \cite*{Monforti2014}. 


{\color{red}As much as we were able to forecast the variability of solar/wind resources in the short term and in the long-term characterize the resource and estimates and project the energy to be produced, better flexibility measures and strategies could be apply to integrate high rates of VRE without compromise reliable and efficiency.}

% For example on the supply side, the kind of flexibility is accomplished through power plants with
% different response time. Introducing variable power generation such as wind and solar power may
% increase the need of energy system flexibility, which could be accomplished through additional measures
% on the supply or/and demand side which is the subject of this paper. From the electricity system point of
% view, flexibility relates closely to grid frequency and voltage control, delivery uncertainty and variability
% and power ramping rates
\section{Variability sources in PV}

It is important to notice that every power system has associated an inherent uncertainty and variability and it is not only a renewable energy systems characteristic. In the case of PV systems, the variability of PV outputs depends on two items: on the first place, it depends on the variability linked to the solar irradiation reaching the generator (resource variability), and secondly, it also depends on the behaviour of the electrical components.  

% ``Before focusing on the variability and uncertainty of PV plants, it is important to understand that
% variability and uncertainty are inherent characteristics of power systems. Loads, power lines,
% and generator availability and performance all have a degree of variability and uncertainty
% It is clear that uncertainty in photovoltaic power it is a combination of the uncertainty of estimation of solar resource and the uncertainty in the behaviour of the electrical componentes of the photovoltaic system.''
{\color{red}Solar radiation varies in multiple time-scales, from seconds to multi-decadal variations, as well as spatially, affecting PV production. For the operating activities in PV plants, an accurate forecasting of solar irradiation, which means, being able to reproduce its short-term variabilty, leads to better forecasting of the PV output demanded by TSOs. In longer time-scales, determining variability features improves the estimation of the PV output for a period of time: seasonal, year-to-year produced energy, multi-year trends or climate change projections. That helps in the plannification, the strategy, the financing activities, and the polycimakers decisions.}  

{\color{red}Different factors are responsible of the variability either of solar resource or the electrical components of the PV generator and affect them across different time and spatial scales.}

\subsection{Astronomical factors}

The amount of solar energy that reaches the photovoltaic generator depends on the first place on the sun position, which is a deterministic factor that only depends on the time of the year and the time of the day. It means that the first factor causing PV intermittency is the fact that no energy can be produced during night-time. However, although this daily scale intermittency is the one that most affects the PV power production there is no uncertainty associated to this fact, which is a very important concept in order to manage VRE.

\subsection{Atmospheric factors}

\subsubsection{Clouds}

There are other factors that affect the solar energy reaching the surface and it depends on the composition of the atmosphere at each time. When solar radiation goes through the atmosphere it can be reflected, absorbed or scattered. The presence of clouds is the most affecting factor in the transmission of solar radiation to the surface. The condensed particles that forms clouds makes solar radiation being scattered and reflected and part of the radiation can also be absorbed. Different types of clouds affects differently to solar radiation \cite*{Page2012}. High thin clouds are less dense than low clouds, becoming more transparent to solar radiation \cite*{Kasten1980}. %Also, some clouds are less spatially aggregated than others. When the sky is overcasted, the amount of energy reaching the surface decrease but the frequency of the intermittency generated in the PV output is not as high as if some individual clouds pass through.

For partially cloudy skies, solar irradiance (direct component) can drop in seconds \cite*{Page2012} due to clouds. In overcasted periods, shorth.term variations depends on the tipe of clouds. Low frequency changes in cloud cover have been observed for large areas, meaning changes in solar resource for that places.

\subsubsection{Aerosols}

Aerosols is the term used to refered to the solid particles suspended on gas. In this work we are refering to the atmospheric aerosols, which are the solid particles suspended on the atmosphere but the hydrometheors like ice crystals [Olivier Boucher]. In the absence of clouds, aerosols are the main source of variability for solar resource. 

Aerosols impact solar radiation in two ways: directly, scattering, absorbing or reflecting solar radiation or indirectly, acting as condensation nuclei favouring the formation of clouds [libro: Atmospheric aerosols: properties and climate impacts]. They can be classified depending on its source origin. Natural sources emit aerosols from oceans, wild fires and vegetation, whereas antrophogenic sources emit aerosols from industrial activities, burning fuels and human-caused fires.

%  Natural sources consist of emissions from
% the ocean, soils, vegetation, fires, and volcanoes. Anthropogenic sources are
% largely dominated by emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels (i.e. coal
% and oil), biofuels (plant biomass including wood, vegetable oils, animal waste),
% other fuels (e.g. peat), or vegetation fires caused by humans. Industrial activities,
% transportation, heating, or even domestic activities related to cooking in developing
% countries, are important sources of aerosol

Aerosols vary greatly in time and accross space [Kaufman]. Besides of aerosols relatively short residence time in the atmosphere (of the order of hours to weeks), they have an strong influence on climate through their impat on the radiative budget and clouds (nabat). Aerosols from natural sources, like mineral dust airbons, which last some days, have a very strong seasonality, affecting in regional and continental scales periodically.  Also, due to the relationship between aerosols and human activities, long time cooling trends have been detected in China for last decades related to the increase in aerosols optical thickness (Giorgi 2002) and other studies analyses the ``dimming'' period in Europe as a consequence of increase in antrophosperic aerosols emissions.,

%aerosols. Solar Energy 2012, 86, 3544 – 3553.

\subsection{PV system factors}

\subsubsection{Spatial aggregation}

There are two factors related to the spatial dimension that influence on the photovoltaic power variability:

\begin{itemize}
\item {Power plant size}
  A PV power plant acts like a low-pass filter for short-fluctuations, which means that higher frequencies of power fluctuations (less than a minute) from the PV generator are smoothed as a function of the PV plant size \cite*{Perpinan2011, Perpinan2013}.
\item {Between power plants distance}
  On the other hand, it has been also concluded that for a fleet of dispersed PV plants, ahort-term power output fluctuations are attenuated. Some authors observed thar short-term fluctuations are essentially uncorrelated for distances between PV plants over 6 km.\cite*{Otani1997, Wiemken2001, Hoff2012}
\end{itemize}

%{\color{red}Another important factor that affects PV output fed into the grid is the PV generator size or even distance between different PV power plants. In the short and very short time scales,  This is called te smoothing effect and it can be used as one of the strategies to follow in order to address the variability issue of renewables.}

\subsubsection{Other factors}

As it has been noted at the beginning of the section, there are other factors that affects the performance of the PV system, causing variations in the PV output. These factors are related to the electrical components of the system and they can be divided into internal and external facors.

The most important external factor affecting the performance of the system is temperature. It affects cells performance and if temperature is highly different than the optimun cell temperature the efficiency will drop. Also some external factors like dust deposition can affect the electrical performance, limiting the energy reaching the cell \cite*{Fan1986, Mekhilef2012,Dubey2013}.

Internal factors affecting the PV output that can cause variability are related to the transmission lines, wires and interconnections, or the inversor, whose performance is not always constant and can present variations.

\section{Short-term variability}%Photovolatic power forecasting

%Considerando los distintos factores que intervienen en la variabilidad de la producción fortovoltaica antes mencionados, queda reflejado que el estudio de la variabilidad puede hacerse bien desde el punto de vista del recurso, es decir, de la radiación solar en superficie o incidente en el generador, o bien desde el punto de vista de la generación eléctrica.[widen]

From the different factors that influence in variability of PV power production, it is shown that variability studies can be made through the solar resource point of view or from the power variability side \cite*{Widen2015}.
%El estudio de la variabilidad a corto plazo desde el punto de vista del recurso ha venido ligado a la ivestigación sobre la caracterización del la radiación solar en superficie.

%lleva a analizar PV production 'ramps' provocadas por cambios en la radiación solar incidente asociados al movimiento de nubes y el efecto 'smoothing' antes mencionado.

% Por otro lado, el tamaño del generador es un factor que ha sido estudiado para determinar la variabilidad en escalas de tiempo entre tal y tal, observándose que :

% he main research question in current solar variability research is which degree of smoothing of the intra-hourly fluctuations can be achieved with different degrees of geographical dispersion of irradiance sensors or PV systems (see Section 4.4). Current research efforts are in particular focused on determining the relationships between cloud speeds, correlations between sites, time resolution and overall variability. Previous overviews of the field can be found e.g. in [1,8,70,71]. The time scales focused on in current research on solar variability range from several minutes down to seconds. The
% relevant time scale depends on the correlation between these sites, which in turn depends on the distances between them. The shorter the time scale, the faster the decline in correlation. Determining the variability for completely correlated or uncorrelated ensembles of systems is straightforward [72], while the range in-between is non-trivial. For example, [70,73,74] and other studies indicate that close-to-zero correlation is reached at a few up to tens of km for resolutions of seconds or minutes, which is the spatial and temporal scale least explored in existing research
% [70,75].

% Also, the smoothing effect that a well-spread site planning has on the PV production is being investigated: [Mar+12], [PML13].

%The energy that is obtained from a photovoltaic system can be forecasted in advance if the amount of solar energy that reach the generator surface is accurately predicted. The prediction of solar irradiation variability enhance the forecast of the energy output. After that, it is necessary to model the electical components of PV generator. 

%%%%%%%%%%%% ELimino esto porque es un lío con lo de clear sky pero tengo que coger alguna referencia (Tovar)%%%%
%There are different types of forecasting methods for solar power, they are based on the models that forecast solar irradiation. Among them there are two different approaches: \textbf{physical methods} and \textbf{statistical methods}. Physical methods are based on the radiative transfer equation and physic variables whereas the statistical or empirical methods are based on historical data. Some approaches are also \textbf{hybrid} approaches that combined both \cite*{Diagne2013, Tovar-Pescador2008}. They mainly rely on two principles: first an estimation of the clear-sky irradiance and secondly, they account for the presence of clouds [ref Jan Kleiss].  


\subsubsection{Solar irradiation forecasting}

There are different types of forecasting methods for solar irradiation. There are two different approaches: \textbf{physical methods} and \textbf{statistical methods}. Physical methods are based on the radiative transfer equation and physic variables whereas the statistical or empirical methods are based on historical data.

The application of each kind of the forecasting model is very related to the \textbf{forecast horizon} that want to be addressed as well as the horizontal resolution. In the operation activities, 3 time forecasting horizons were described by Kostylev and Palovsky \cite*{kostylev2011solar}: intra-hour, intra-day, day-ahead. For trading purpose, the day-ahead forecast is very important as well as for planning operations.% in longer time-scales seasonal forecast will be a very valuable asset if model skill improves [ref]. 

\begin{itemize}
\item{Physical Methods}

The physical modeling of solar radiation is based on physical equations of the interaction between atmospheric components and solar radiation (aerosols, water vapour, clouds...). When solar radiation goes through the atmosphere, it can interact with its components being absorbed by molecules, back-scattered to space or scattered in any other direction. Thus, only part of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) will reach the Earth's surface.

This process is the physical process of energy transfer described by the radiative transfer equation (RTE) and its solution needs a radiative transfer model (RTM). The radiative transfer is a very complex process that needs to be simplified to be solved numerically and some parametrizations are needed. However, from these models it is possible to reproduce the solar radiation behaviour across the atmosphere and at the surface. RTMs are in the core of numerical weather prediction models, NWP, and climate models and sometimes they are used to obtain solar radiation from satellite images, although in this case empirical or semi-empirical approaches are also commonly applied.

Numerical weather prediction models are very useful in a time range from 4h to 6h and they are also applied for the day-ahead forecast [ref Perez]. It is very frequent to apply a post-processing process to the output of NWP that enhance the forecast. Some statistical tools like bias correction can be apply to reduce some systematic errors or local effects \cite*{Diagne2013}.

{\color{red} Introducir aquí que en el desarrollo de NWP no se han incluido aerosoles ?}

\item{Statistical methods}

Solar radiation at the surface can be estimated also using statistical methods. In this case it is necessary to have enough accuarate historical data to create and validate the model and likely these models will not be able to reproduce solar behaviour universally. However, they can be very useful for local applications and at very high time-resolution.

Under these methods traditionally used to forecast time-series, relies the idea of predict some variables throught the statistical analysis of historical data and its relationship with other variables called predictors. Many models have been developed in this sense from the most simple approach, the persistence model, or autorregressive models to more sophisticated ones \cite*{Reikard2009, bacher2009, Inman2013}. 

{\color{red} escalas temporales: short term and very short-term}. Se analiza el impacto de las nubes -> muy común aplicar un modelo de cielo claro y después la influencia de las nubes. Describir aquí lo que son los modelos de cielo claro?}

{\color{blue} meter aquí clear-sky models? y que pasa con los de satélite}

Developing of the ANN and non-linear models have been also applied to solar forecasting field, in that case the predictions are based on an algorithm learning \cite{Mellit2008}. 


% Statistical methods have been used successfully in time series forecasting for
% several decades. Using the statistical approach, relations between predictors,
% variables used as an input to the statistical model, and the variable to be predicted,
% are derived from statistical analysis. Several studies with respect to
% direct time series modeling have been performed. In Reikard [2], different time
% series models are compared. In Bacher and al.[7], the authors investigate the
% use of a simpler AR model to directly predict PV power in comparison with
% other models.
\item{Hybrid methods}

It is very common to apply a combination of more than one model to enhance the prediction accuracy. Many studies have shown the overcome of a combination of two different approaches with respect to a simpler approach \cite*{Diagne2017, Yang2014}. For instance, some studies show the application of ANN methods after the obtention of NWP output \cite*{Cornaro2015} or after obtain a satellite-based model output \cite*{Marquez2013}\\

\centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/forecast.png}
\caption{Models to forecast irradiance depending on the time horizon. Incluir ref aunque se va a rehacer}
\label{fig:forecast}
\end{figure}


Different models are applied depending on the forecast horizon as they are summarised in the figure. Usually, the main steps in the solar irradiation forecast are first the estimation of the clear-sky irradiance and after that account for the presence of clouds ref[Jan Kleiss].

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Aerosols in solar irradiation forecasting}

Although clouds are the main driver of variability of solar resource, under cloudless conditions, aerosols reduce the amount of solar energy reaching the earth surface. Some models compute solar irradiance in clear sky conditions, which means that the they calculate attenuation of solar irradiation only due to the constituents of the atmosphere. Many clear-sky models has been proposed on the literature []. The difference between clear-sky models is based on the parameters used to predict solar irradiance. The most simplest ones only consider the zenith angle and extraterrestrial irradiation. The higher the complexity of the model, the more parameters are included to characterise the state of the atmosphere: different aerosols content, water vapour etc. Performance of this models depends on the parametrizations of each model and the knowdlege of the atmospheric composition.
 
These models are commonly used in to derive solar irradiation from satellite observations (see chapter data). As satellite are able to give observations of the cloudiness at a given time and site, the use of a clear sky model in combination with this sobservation make easy to establish a relationship between the cloud index and the clear sky index . The role of aerosols input in these satellite-based methods to derived solar irradiation has been investigated in [Polo 2014]. 

On the other side, under high loads of AOD, NWP usually presents a systematic bias in solar radiation forecast [riegen]. This fact is due to the design of the models that normally use climatological values for the representation of aerosols with homogeneous spatially and temporally concentrations.[riegen]. This fact lead to an overstimation of solar irradiation in the dust outbreak of 4 april 2014 in Germany, which caused significant economic losses.

%{\color{blue} Aquí podemos hablar de los aerosoles, que impactan en la predicción de la irradiancia porque afectan a su variabilidad. Númerosos métodos de NWP están desarrollando módulos para tener en cuenta los aerosoles. Por otro lado, estos pueden ser tenidos en cuenta en los modelos estadísticos como predictores. Un buen ejemplo son los modelos de cielo claro, que estiman la radicaciónn en condiciones de cloudless, por lo que los aerosoles son el factor determinante. En este caso, únicamente una buena representación de los aerosoles puede dar un buen valor de la radiación solar en superficie.}\\

% \subsection{Clear-sky models}

% Among the different approaches to model or forecast solar irradiation at the surface clear-sky models deserves special attention. These models estimate solar irradiation under clear-sky conditions, which means that the attenuation of solar irradiation is only due to the constituents of the atmosphere and not due to clouds.

% The difference between clear-sky models is based on the parameters used to predict solar irradiance. The most simplest ones only consider the zenith angle and extraterrestrial irradiation. The higher the complexity of the model, the more parameters are included to characterise the state of the atmosphere: different aerosols content, water vapour etc. 
% The amount of energy that reaches the surface depends on the transmittance of the atmosphere. The incident extraterrestrial irradiance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) would be attenuated depending on the composition of the atmosphere thus in the air mass (AM) crossed to reach the surface. For the latter reason, the zenith angle is the first factor to consider when the surface solar irradiation want to be estimated: with higher zenith angles, higher the air mass. The simplest models based on this parameters are empirical relationships based on measurements for an specific location. Evaluations of these models have shown that it is necessary to take care when applying for a different location that the one used for its calibration \cite*{Badescu1997, Davies1989}.

% In addition to these simple models, some parameters can be considered enhancing the performance of the forecast. The Kasten model [] and the Inchen and Perez [] (that is a modification of the first one) use the zenith angle, the air mass, the elevation and the the Linke turbidity, a parameter that describes the optical thickness of the atmosphere.

% The most sophisticated clear-sky models includes more parameters like the ozone, aerosols and precipitable water. Some of the most used models are Bird, MAC, or REST2[]. There are several studies that summarises a benchmark of different clear-sky models \cite*{Gueymard2013a,b}. It is clear that there is a relationship between the more atmospheric variables included in the model, the better the performance. But measures of all variables included are not always available. Due to that reason, the best model would arise from a balance relationship between the availability of atmospheric measurements to calibrate the model and its performance.

%\subsection{Satellite-based models}

% Due to the scarcity of solar radiation measurements, the availability of satellite data has become an important trigger for the development of targeted products for the solar industry [ref].

% There are different methods to retrieve solar radiation from satellite images that goes from physical models to empirical ones. In the first case, the models try to explain the radiance observed by the satellite instrumentation with a radiation transfer model (RTM). In order to do that, it is necessary to know the composition of the atmosphere. On the other hand, empirical models are based on simple regression models between the visible-channel's recorded intensity and grounded measurements. 

% It is possible to extract cloudiness information from the satellite radiance information due to the fact that intensity of the measurements change depending on the composition of the atmosphere and the cloud cover. Considering that, a simple equation can describe the relationship between the radiance measured and the amount of clouds, this was called \textbf{cloud index [Cano].}

% To retrieve solar radiation form satellites, most empirical methods considers a linear relationship between the cloud index and atmospheric transmittance \cite*{Polo2008} [Polo libro, (Cano et al. 1986; Diabaté et al. 1988; Schmetz. 1989; Diabaté et al. 1989; Noia et al. 1993a; Ineichen and Perez. 1999; Zelenka et al. 1999; Perez 2002; Rigollier et al. 2004; Zarzalejo et al. 2005)].  

% %* cloud index?
% %* clear sky index ?

% There are also some approaches that are in between theses two sides: the semi-empirical models, which have become the most common approach \cite*{Polo2008}. They use a simple radiative-transfer scheme and some statistical regressions between data from satellite sensors and observed data (Schmetz (1989), Noia et al. (1993), Pinker et al. (1995), Zelenka (2001), and Hammer et al (2003)).\footnote{Jan Kleiss, Solar Energy Forecasting and Resource assessment, pp.22.23}

% There are two types of satellites orbiting the earth: The polar orbiting, closer to the earth surface,  with high spatial resolution but limitations in the temporal coverage, and the geostationary satellites (~36000km from the earth's surface) with high spatial and temporal resolution. This last kind of satellites are the commonly used to derived solar radiation at the surface.

% The uncertainty in the satellite radiation estimation comes from different sources. First, Sun elevation affects the determination of clouds position due to the increase of reflections, increasing  the uncertainty for low Sun elevation. Other factors are related to geographical factors. The high albedo of some surfaces like desserts or ice areas makes difficult the determination of clouds, increasing uncertainty (Cebecauer et al. 2011).

\subsection{PV variability}
\subsubsection{PV power forecasting methods}

Once the solar radiation is either modeled or measured, the AC output from a PV system can be modeled following two main principles \cite*{Almeida2015}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Parametric models
\item Nonparametric models
\end{itemize}

In the first place, \textbf{parametric models} are a set of equations that model each step of the electricity generation: decomposition of solar irradiation in different components, its transposition to the tilt panel of the generator, the behaviour of the PV generator and the inverter to finally get the electricity output. The advantage of this type of models is that can be applied idependently to each loaction. This approach is been used for many authors \cite*{Bofinger2006, Lorenz2008, Lorenz2011} with differences in the sub-models applied in each case.

The \textbf{nonparametric models}, on the other hand, consider the whole PV system as a black box and only takes into account the input data (variables as solar irradiation and temperature) and output historical data, developing an statistical model from the measured values. The constrains related to this approach is that this method can only be applied when the historical time-series are long enough to be representative of the PV plant \cite*{Bacher2009}. 

\subsubsection{Smoothing effect}

Además de con la predicción de la producción fotovoltaica, que es sin duda un elemento clave en el manejo de la intermitencia de las plantas renovables y en su integración en el sitema eléctrico, la variabilidad puede abordarse mediante el estudio denominado ``smoothing effect''.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Generator size}
\item{Distance between power plants}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Aerosols}

The impact of aerosols in photovoltaic energy production has been also studied from the power side. In the short-term, some  extreme events like dust outbreaks has been analysed, due to the impact on a daily basis that they have in PV production. Some authors have seen reductions of PV production in semi-arid regions up to $48\%$ , like the Sahel zone \cite*{Neher2017}. For the western mediterranean, the impact of two extreme events of high loads of dust in one side and smoke on the other were studied and they showed a reduction of $34\%$ for smoke and $6\%$ for dust on daily averages \cite*{Gomez-Amo2019}. For larger areas, the impact of en extreme event in April 2014 over Germany, shows that aerosols could reduce PV production in a country causing large economic losses if these events are not previously forecasted \cite*{Rieger2017}.

\section{From short to long term issues}%Photovoltaic power projections}%{}

Nature variability of solar resource is also present in longer time-scales, affecting different stages of photovoltaic projects, from feasibility to finance, and having influence also in strategic decisions from some stakeholders like operators and policymakers.

It deserves to be mentioned, that at the same time that frequence of time variability is decreasing, the space variable defined as the horizontal extension in which different patterns can be observed, is expanding because lower frequency changes in solar resource (and other renewable resources linked to atmospheric conditions) are most of the times related to large-scale amospheric patterns that affects larger in space. On the contrary, short-term frequency changes, are related to weather regimes as well, but are affected locally by specific conditions like the transition of clouds. That means that for longer time scales, not only individual PV projects are the target of the analysis, but also an overall study of bigger areas can arise from this. For instance: developing strategies for deploying renewable energies in a country, the analysis of the portfolio's variability of a company, future strategies attending trends and low frequence variations, etc. 
 
 

\subsection{Solar Resource Variability}

For the resource side, much of the research in long-term variability of solar irradiation has not been focused on its application for solar energy. Long-term variability of solar irradiation has been studied because of its main role in the earth's energy budget [ref], which is a key for understanding the climate system and its variability. Also, variability of atmospheric variables in seasonal to interannual scales have been also investigated in relation to large-scale circulation modes and teleconnections across different areas [Trocoli]. Therefore, the application of some of the main results comes from the climate community. Nevertheless, directly linked with the power production some studies had arised recently from them, in order to facilitate the risk analysis for PV power deployment [Bryce].

% \subsubsection{Interannual variability}

\subsubsection{Large-scale circulation modes}

From \textbf{seasonal} to \textbf{interannual} time scales, local or regional climate is the main driver of solar irradiation variability reaching the Earth's surface. This regional climate variability is partly due to patterns of variability (modes) of the atmospheric circulation. ``This \textit{modes} represent preferred spatial patterns and their temporal variation also accounting for teleconnections which describe climate links between geographically separated regions. Modes  are described as a product of a spatial climate pattern and an associated climate index time series that are identified based on statistical methods like Principal Component Analysis (PC analysis)''.

%``In addition, regional climate can be strongly affected by non-local responses to recurring patterns (or modes) of variability of the atmospheric circulation or the coupled atmosphere–ocean system. These modes of variability represent preferred spatial patterns and their temporal variation. They account for gross features in variance and for teleconnections which describe climate links between geographically separated regions. Modes of variability are often described as a product of a spatial climate pattern and an associated climate index time series that are identified based on statistical methods like Principal Component Analysis (PC analysis), which is also called Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis (EOF analysis), and cluster analysis.

%On intraseasonal to interannual time scales, the climate of the United States is strongly affected by modes of atmospheric circulation variability like the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)/Northern Annular Mode (NAM), North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), and Pacific/North American Pattern (PNA). , , These modes are closely linked to other atmospheric circulation phenomena like blocking and quasi-stationary wave patterns and jet streams that can lead to weather and climate extremes. On an interannual time scale, coupled atmosphere–ocean phenomena like El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have a prominent effect. On longer time scales, U.S. climate anomalies are linked to slow variations of sea surface temperature related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). , ,

%These modes of variability can affect the local-to-regional climate response to external forcing in various ways. The climate response may be altered by the forced response of these existing, recurring modes of variability. Further, the structure and strength of regional temperature and precipitation impacts of these recurring modes of variability may be modified due to a change in the background climate. Modes of internal variability of the climate system also contribute to observed decadal and multidecadal temperature and precipitation trends on local to regional scales, masking possible systematic changes due to an anthropogenic influence. However, there are still large uncertainties in our understanding of the impact of human-induced climate change on atmospheric circulation. , Furthermore, the confidence in any specific projected change in ENSO variability in the 21st century remains low.''

Climatic variability of surface solar radiation over \textbf{Euro-Mediterranean} area has been asociated to large-scale circulation patterns in several studies \cite*{Jerez2013a, Chiacchio2010, Sanchez-Lorenzo2009, Pozo-Vazquez2004}. This large-scale modes, are drivers of cloudiness patterns, which is the main variability source for solar irradiation.

The \textbf{North Atlantic Oscilation}, NAO, is the variation in the pressure differencies between the High of the Azores and the Low of Iceland. This difference has an associated index, whose sign (positive or negative) determine if the difference is lower or higher than the mean difference. The last cause the storm track coming from the east to affect the European continent shoutherly, which means more clouds in the south, whereas the former, increase the difference between the High and Low systems, shifting the storm track to the northern Europe. This changes in cloudiness asociated to the NAO phase have therefore asociated changes in surface solar radiation.

A dipolo pattern behaviour has been described for the correlation between the NAO index and sunshine duration measurements \cite*{Pozo-Vazquez2004} over Europe. The maximum of the dipolo is found over the Iberian Peninsula for the positive phase and the minimum over Norway. Anomalies over IP has been reported to be around 10-20$\%$ for the positive phase and -20 to -30$\%$ for the negative phase.

Another study analysed solar, wind and hydropower resources for the Iberian Peninsula and its relationship with different large-scale modes: NAO index SCAN, .... Only the NAO had a significant impact on the \textbf{interannual variabilility} of the resources. In the case of solar radiation, an strong correlation is found between the index and the monthly time series \cite*{Jerez2013a}. This study is focused in months from Octibre to March, du to the fact that for the rest of the months results were not significant.

In order to characterize interannual variability of some regions with a comparable metric, the coefficient of variability has been used in different studies accross different regions. One of the first efforts to characterize not only interannual variability but also spatial variability was made by Wilcox 2010, where the CV was identified for individual sites among the State of Washington finding variations from low to high (15$\%$) interannual CV.

In the Euro-Mediterranean area, different works have evaluated interannual variability of solar resource through the CV. However, due to the lack of dense network with long-term observations over the same aera, some authors have analysed the interannual variability through the sunshine duration measurements [ref]. In [] the \textbf{coefficient of variability} is used to quantify interannual variability over the IP, showing an in general quite stable solar resource, with differences among the stations. Other authors have studied interannual variability over a location of the IP using remote sensing data, obtaining the same magnitude order for the CV [pozo vazquez 2011]. Also, reanalyses data of ERA-40 is used to analyse interannual variability of different variables over the IP. [perdigao 2011]

%\subsubsection{Monthly to seasonal}

 
%Intereannual variability of monthly solar irradiation series has been evaluated related to large-scales circulation modes [Interannual Variability and Seasonal Predictability of Wind and Solar Resources, S.Jerez]. Certain grade of correlation between solar (and wind) anomalies and these modes has been found [ref]. To the extent that those modes are predictable they could be directly linked with anomalies in solar (and wind) resource, which would help in the seasonal forecasting for solar power, although these correlations greater for some locations rather than a global behaviour. Some results has been seen in these sense for wind seasonal forecasting and its relationship with the NAO [Clark, R.T.; Bett, P.E.; Thornton, H.E.; Scaife, A.A. Skilful seasonal predictions for the European energy industry. Environmental Research Letters 2017, 12, 024002]

\subsubsection{low frequency changes}

In longer perspectives, trends have been also evaluated because of multi-year variability and the presence of periods known as “dimming” and “brightening” (Müller et al. 2014, Wild 2015, wild 2005). Changes in surface radiation has been evaluated from observations [], with a modeling approach [] and through satellite observations [].

A global decrease in surface radiation, refered as \textbf{dimming} period,  has been reported until 1980s. Afterwards, in some areas, like Europe or North America, or China an increase was observed. It was named \textbf{brightening} period. 

Regionally, the magnitude of the trends are different and also they differs on the sign [Wild, M. 2012: Enlightening Global Dimming and Brightening. Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 93]. For instance, from the 80's, there is a general brightening although for India, a decrease of -8 $W/m^2$  per decade is observed. From the year 2000, USA and Europe shows an increase in surface radiation trend but China and India still shows a significant decrease trend of-4 and -10 $W/m^2$ per decade. 

The global dimming phenoma has been studied as a result of the increase in a anthropogenic aerosols emissions, finding consistent changes in surface radiation related to sufur and black carbon emissions between 1980-2000 [Streets 2006, Norris and Wild 2006].

{\color{red} Referencias de clear-sky de wild para aclarar un poco más el paper de la nubosidad y el de los aerosoles en europa. leer algunas de las referencias sobre aerosoles.}

Over Europe, low-requency changes in solar irradiation are less correlated with changes in cloud cover than the seasonal series in the area [Sanchez lorenzo, wild and chiaccio] although it also depends on the season. For instance, as it was previously commented, winter series are hihgly correlated with the NAO index. [WIld and Chiacchio] found that on decadal seasonal changes, other parameters, suggesting changes in antrophogenic aerosols emissions are influencing, like it was pointed out in other studies [ref]. Also, they suggest that the indirect effect of aerosols is also responsible of changes in the correlation between surface radiation and NAO.

% These references showed that decadal variability of solar radiation goes blabla.
Analysis trough clear-sky series were also analysed showing significant trends over areas of central and eastern Europe for some decades that are clearly related to dimming and brightening periods.

%The \textbf{dimming} period over Europe over the 80's and its following \textbf{brightening} period has been extensively evaluated [ref]. These studies showed the relationship between the increase in anthropogenic aerosol emissions over the area and the dimming period and its decrease with the the latter brightening.[ref].

Over the Iberian Peninsula, some long-term series of sunshine duration and its relationhip with cloud cover were analysed by []. For most of the seasons, sunshine records and total cloud cover are strongly negative correlated, although some areas in the southern part and in summer have weaker correlations [Sanchez Lorenze]. The results are part of the large scale dipolo pattern between the North and the South of the Euro-Atlantic sector []. Besides, other more regional atmospheric patterns influence in variability of sunshine duration series. It is worth it to mention that for residual clear sky sunshine duration series, it is found correlation with particular atmospheric circulation pattern that might be related to the impact og anthropogenic aerosols emission on the dynamics of the atmospheric circulation at synoptic scales [].

The use of satellite datasets of solar radiation (and clouds in some cases []) had helped in order to see spatial patterns and analyse multi-decadal variability in large areas with no available irradiation data. For Europe, they had been used to analysed long-term series and trends of surface solar radiation. For the period between 1983-2010 an overall mean increase of 2 $W/m^2$ per decade has been reported over Europe after the analysis of satellite-derived data. This result is due to changes in cloud cover, due to the lack of aerosols variation in satellite products. Further analysis had shown that for the same period, some residual trends obtained from the difference beween the satellite and on ground measurements, showed a higher increase in central and eastern Europe suggesting the brightening period related to anthropogenic aerosols reduction.

Further analysis using more recent satellite dateset product [ref] for the period 1983-2015 shows a general increase of surface solar radiation over Europe (between 1.9 and 2.4 $W/m^2$ per decade), due to a decrease in cloud cover. The difference with resepct to observation is attributed to changes in direct aerosols effect and snow cover [ref]. 


%``Long-term trends in GHI and DNI are also of importance because of the succession of periods known as “dimming” and “brightening,” which affect both climate change and the extrapolation of the historical solar resource into the future (Müller et al. 2014, Wild 2015)''

% In the first stage of a project, historical long-term data for site selection is needed in order to assess its feasibility. This stage is called \textbf{solar resource assessment} and it is the first stage in order to characterize resource of a place.


% Cuando la energía obtenida por un sistema fotovoltaica no quiere ser predecida en el corto plazo, sino que es necesaria para diferentes etapas de los proyectos fotovoltaicos como la planifcación, la viabilidad, o las operaciones de financiación, ésta será estimada o proyectada en escalas temporales más largas, considerando

% Longer time scales has been evaluated for other stages of PV projects apart from the operating activities.

% This phase consist on the evaluation of solar resource in order to estimate the potential energy that can be obtain with a project in an area. Also, this estimation is been useful for communicating potential of different renewable energy resources across different countries to plan and define strategies by policymakers.

% %\subsubsection{Solar resource assessment}

% Solar \textbf{resource assessment} needs long time series of solar irradiation data in order to capture the climatic characteristics. In that sense, it would be necessary a wide-spread network of stations recording solar radiation. Up to now, the scarcity of this measurements makes difficult to obtain accurate and long time series for every place where the solar resource wants to be measured. Satellite data has become the best option to get long time series record of high spatial and temporal resolution data. These data allows to characterise variability which is useful to determine the suitability of a short-term data set to produce valid long-term statistics [NREL, best practices]. For instance, it is common to use a typical meteorological year to assess the potential energy in a place. However, some studies has shown that this practice it is not accurate, at least for certain places, if direct normal irradiation (DNI) want to be characterise [Gueymard]. Years with higher loads of aerosols, which affects directly on DNI, are excluded if only TMY is used for the financial assessment of a CSP proyect. Global solar irradiation is less variable than direct normal irradiation, but quantifying inter-annual variability becomes important in all solar projects favouring management.

\subsection{Resource assessment}

Characterization of solar irradiance for a region or an specific location over an historical period is being called \textit{resource assessment}. This is an important step for the first phase of a solar project, feasibility and afterward, for the design phase. 
% ``Solar-resource assessment is the characterization of solar irradiance available for energy conversion for a region or specific location over a historical time period of interest. ''

The resource assessment phase stage needs a solar irradiation database that accounts for long-term historical data of the area in order to estimate the amount of energy that can be obtained with the project. However, as it is seen before, it is not an easy task to account for solar irradiation measurements and other type of data is usually considered. Different products are available most of them derived from satellite observations [ref].

{\color{red} mirar aqui best practices}

It has been considered that in annual terms solar resource is stable in comparison with other renewable resources [ref]. However, this belief has lead to the fact that mistakes in calulation of interannual variability results in one of the biggest risk in a solar project [ref libro + bryece].

One of the common datasets that has been historically used for solar resource assessment is the TMY: typical meteorological year of certain location. This datasets is derived from longer time data and tries to summarize the varaibility of meteorological variables in a 12 month dataset. Although this practice has been extensively applied to characterize solar resource, there many studies that have proved that this datasets are not the best to capture the whole variability of the resource and moreover, some extreme events, that can lead to a higher economical impact, are underestimated. [ref libro +gueymard].

Related to low-frequency variability of solar resource, some authors had recomended to use 10 years of accurate data for estimate trends in solar radiation [ref wild and muller]. Due to the decadal changes in surface solar radiation, explained in previous section, a selection of the last 10 years of data is more precised to determine trends. %Also, the fact that in tilted surfaces direct solar irradiation... 

%``the financing community generally considers the solar resource as stable on an annual basis when compared to other renewable resources. However, it also views the material miscalculation of the solar resource as one of the biggest risks in a solar project. Therefore, lenders and rating agencies alike require verification of the solar-resource dataset to be utilized at each project location, as this translates directly into electrical-energy production forecasts and revenues.''

``The variability of the solar resource, as exhibited by historical solar data, and the accuracy of the dataset play significant roles in estimating the probability of future performance, and they influence the financial contract that the project is likely to receive.'' Because  one of the main goals is to estimate the resource risk and minimize that risk due to its commercial and financing impacts.

%``Next, the typical meteorological year (TMY) data files developed from these datasets will be discussed. While TMY files may be suitable for initial evaluations, they generally do not constitute a bankable dataset. Specific examples are given to illustrate the limited value of these files and why it is necessary to utilize the long-term databases from which they were created.''

%La etapa principal en la que escalas temporales largas afectan a los proyectos de producción fotovoltaica es la que se conoce como \textbf{resource assessment}. Esto consite en evaluar y caracterizar el recurso existente para posteriormente analizar la viabilidad del proyecto y estimar la cantidad de energía que será capaz de producir. Para ello, es necesario contar con una base de datos de radiación solar y posteriormente modelar el comportamiento del sistema fotovoltaico.

\subsubsection{Resource risk}}

As in every energy project, there are associated risks that compromise the revenues of the project. Some of them, like technical or commercial, are also in other power projects. However, the uncertainty in the resource that is the ``fuel'' of the power plant is inherent to some renewable energy projects. That is called ``resource risk'' and most of the financing activities of the project are related to it.

In the first place, in order to know if a photovoltaic project is going to be profitable, the amount of energy produced by the potential project is assessed. In order to do that it is necessary to characterize solar resource in the area and to model the performance of the PV plant. This first step is called solar resource assessment, previously explainedm,  and should consider different time-scale variability of the resource: interannual, multi-yerar, long-term trends. 

%In the case of long-term variability, it would be necessary to characterize solar resource in that temporal scales and afterward to model a photovoltaic system in order to estimate and project generated energy in the long-term. This is called resource assessment and it would be developed from a solar radiation database.

%Éstas estimaciones o proyecciones de energía necesitarán de una base de datos de radiación y de la modelización del sistema fotovoltaico. En estas escalas, la variabilidad de las proyecciones de energía dependerán principalmente de tres factores:

Variability of the resource has some commercial implications to be consider. From the variations in price electricity, which would depend on the contract between the project owners and the energy grid operato, to the necessity of match some delivery requirements or even forecasting requirements if the energy produced has to be forecasted in advance for the TSOs etc. [ref libro]

Some risk management techniques are developed in order to address the issue of resource variability: in first place, the probability of excedance gives te probability of exceed certain amount of energy in different time-scales of the project. This measure helps the financial steps giving some threshold based on the historical data.

Secondly, it has to be consider the source of variability in the projected energy. In this case there are three clear sources to be considered:

\begin{itemize}
 \item{Resource variability}
\item{Dataset uncertainty}
\item{Modeling assumptions}
\end{itemize}

 
%All this factors are part of the resource risk. Stakeholders (debt owners or financial entities, equity owners and project owners) try to quantify and manage the resoure risk by different techniques. One of the most applied technique is the \textbf{probability of exceedande}. With this metric, it is wanted to measured the value of energy obtained, whose probability of being exceeded is $90\%$.

%* Aquí se puede hablar más de la gestión del riesgo de recurso.

%This methods, gives an uncertainty to the projected energy of a project, either in annual terms (which is common for some debt requirements), or quaterly, for planning operations.

%However, as it has been seen before, databases used in the resource assessment have not always been as accurate as it would be expected. Moreover, así como en el caso de las actividades de operación los modelos de predicción son un campo de estudio muy activo y la literatura es amplia, el estudio de la variabilidad tanto del recurso solar, como de las proyecciones de energía en escalas más largas es aún limitado. Esto ha provocado, por ejemplo, que algunos proyectos puedan verse afectados financieramente por una mala caracterización de la variabilidad interanual de la producción fotovoltaica, o que un análisis más amplio de escalas multianuales revele tendencias y variabilidad de baja frecuencia que limite las bases de datos existentes.

\subsection{Climate variability and the electricity system}

El incremento de la cantidad de energías renovables en los sistemas eléctricos, hacen que deban ser tenidas en cuenta su sensibilidad climática...
Aunque no es el tema central de esta tesis, merece la pena mencionar algunos de los esfuerzos/ estudios que se están haciendo para entender la sensibilidad de los sistemas, la relación entre demanda y supply etc. Algunos autores han recalcado la poca atención que el impacto de la variabilidad a largo plazo ha tenido en el estudio desde el punto de vista del sistema eléctrico.
Como se ha comentado con anterioridad, a medida que la escala temporal aumenta, el impacto de la variabilidad climática puede también aumentar en escala espacial, influyendo en áreas más amplias del sistema eléctrico.

\section{Future projections and trends}

% {\color{red}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item resource projections
%   \item energy projections
%   \end{itemize}}
    
In a context of climate change, the climate system will evolve and renewable energy resources might be affected. In an scenario of high penetration of renewables, the relationship between changes or constrains in power supply due to changes in resources and, on the other hand, changes in the demand side as a consequence of climate change [ref] is a first order issue to be addressed in coming years [quantifying the increasing  sensitivity of power systems to climate variability].

From the supply side, climate change might impact traditional power plants like large nuclear and coal-fire plants [ref nature and libro de climate services] due to an increase in air temperatures and river flow temperature. However, systems based on these traditional power supply will evolve to a higher renewables penetration scenario. In that sense, a research accross the western US shows that a higher share of renewables makes the power system less vulnerable to climate change risks like events of extreme temperature and severe droughts [Impacts od climate chanfe on electric power suply in the Western United states].  

Different power supply scenarios can be less vulnerable to climate change depending on the technologies. Due to the projected changes in precipitation patterns [] and the expected increase in extreme events like droughts [], hydropower will be likely highly impacted under global warming conditions at least over certain regions. Over Europe, the impact of climate change in power generation has been investigated through its impact to different technologies. It has been found that those impacts can double from a 1ºC warming scenario to a 3ºC. Generally, southern areas in Europe will be more affected due to limited impact on solar and PV but higher impacts on hydropower and thermoelectric generation \cite*{Tobin2018} as it was previously commented.

Some studies have evaluated projections of wind power potential over the same area, analysing the availability of the resource for future scenarios. They show a slightly decrease of wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and Western Europe; and an increase in the Northern areas \cite*{Tobin2015, Tobin2016} projected for 2020 and 2050 respectively. In general, there is no projected changes in the interannual variability.

From a solar perspective, it has to be considerd main results in climate projections and conclusions about modifications in the large scale atmospheric circulation related to global warming, due to its direct link with cloudiness patterns and the storm-track. In the Northern Hemisphere summer, an intensification of the monsoonal regime and associated cloudiness over northern Africa and southern Asia is expected (Gaetani2014). The intensification of the Hadley meridional circulation  will produce downward vertical motions, and associated subsidence and clear sky conditions at subtropical latitudes (Gaetani et al. 2014). On the other hand, for boreal winters, it is expected a modification of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and associated storm-track, which will result in a high-low pressure dipole in the Euro-Atlantic sector, which orientates the westerly flow toward the Scandinavian peninsula, with a consequent excess of cloudiness over the North Atlantic storm-track (Gaetani et al. 2014).

As a result of these changes in the atmospheric circulation, it could be expected an increase in cloudiness over northern Africa, and more clear sky conditions over western Europe and the Mediterranean [ref JRC]. The conditions in the Euro-Atlantic sector can also derives in a reduction of soalr radiation in northern and eastern Europe.

% Specifically, the increase in surface temperature and north-south inter-hemispheric thermal gradient shifts northward and intensifies  the  Hadley  meridional  circulation,  producing  augmented  cloudiness  and  reduced solar radiation over northern Africa, and clear sky and sunny conditions over western Europe and  the  Mediterranean.  Moreover,  the  land-sea  thermal  contrast  in  the  Euro-Atlantic  sector affects the North Atlantic storm-track favouring storminess and reducing solar radiation over northern  and  eastern  Europe.  Consequently,  a  significant  reduction  in  PVE  productivity  is observed in eastern Europe, and northern Africa (up to7 $%$), while an increase is observed in western  Europe,  and  eastern  Mediterranean  (up  to  10  $%$).  The  analysis  of  ENSEMBLES RCM  simulations  shows  coherence  with  the  global  pattern,  and  confirms  the  importance  of aerosols emissions and air quality policy options for the assessment of future climate change and PVE production.


% The state-of-art of atmospheric circulation changes under global warming projects in the Northern Hemisphere summer, an intensification of the  monsoonal regime and associated cloudiness over northern Africa and southern Asia.  The intensification of the Hadley meridional circulation  will produce downward vertical motions, and associated subsidence and clear sky conditions at subtropical latitudes (Gaetani et al. 2014). On the other hand, for boreal winters, it is expected a modification of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and associated storm-track, which will result in a high-low pressure dipole in the Euro-Atlantic sector, which orientates the westerly flow toward the Scandinavian peninsula, with a consequent excess of cloudiness over the North Atlantic storm-track (Gaetani et al. 2014).

%Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy mix plans.

% The performance of photovoltaic systems exhibits a negative linear dependence on the projected temperature increase which is
% outweighed by the expected increase of total radiation resulting in an up to 4$%$ increase in energy output."


Projected changes in solar irradiation potential under climate change scenarios has been investigated in several works addressing different areas [Crook, Wild, Jerez, TobinGrecia and Bartok]. Some of theme are focused on solar radiation (Bartok) rather than in photovoltaic potential because they have a climate perspective. Different tools have been used in each of the studies mentioned before. On one hand, global climate models, with coarser resolution has analysed changes in solar irradiation globally, using ensembles form different projects CMIP5, CMIP3 or an specific model to run sensitivity cases. Other studies, have been focused on regional scales, using regional climate simulation models, from PRUDENCE, ENSEMBLES and more recen EURO-CORDEX project.

Global projections using GCMs has been evaluated in [Crook] and later in [wild] showing an overall decrease in large areas around the globe with exceptions in some regions like Europe, South-East of China and to lesser extent South-East of North-America. In the latter, that is made using CMIP5 CLIMATE simulations, projected changes between 2006 and 2049 under the RCP8.5 scenario overall are on the order of 1$%$/decade for horizontal planes, but may be larger for tilted or tracked planes as well as on shorter (decadal) timescales.  

Other works show more regional results making use of regional climate models, RCMs. Main results in solar resource for Europe shows a discrepancy between Global Models, GCMs, and Regional Climate Models, RCMs\footnote{Climate models are explained in section x of chapter 4}. Whereas most of global model simulations show an increase of solar resource and photovoltaic potential over Europe (poner el porcentaje), some research have shown a small decrease of photovoltaic potential in the same area, mostly for northern and central part of Europe, asociated with the increase in the total cloud cover []. Altough some studies have investigated the discrepancy between Global and Regional Climate models projections over Europe \cite*{Bartok2017}, there are still some uncertainties that deserves to take attention.

For some local studies, the effect of changes in solar irradiation and temperature has been evaluated with RCM simulations. For Greece, some bias corrected simulations were evaluated and different signals accross the country were found. Generally, the south projected an increase between 1 and 3$\%$ and the north part a decrease of roughly the same magnitude. 

Another local analysis is recently made over the Iberian Peninsula, where the study investigates changes in the interannual variability under climate change scenarios. The analyses is conducted using different RCMs and it is found that solar resource over the IP will increase and also a decrease in the interannual variability is projected.

\subsubsection{Aerosols}

One of the sources of uncertainty in future climate projections is the evolution of anthropogenic aerosols emissions and its interation with climate. The knowledge about direct and indirect effects of aerosols in climate remains little known in some aspects [ref] and a it deserves still research effor. In this aspect, the representation of aerosols in climate simulations is not always take into account.  

Therefore, due to its potential impact not only in climate but also directly in some important variables like solar irradiation, its a matter to be considered for renewable resource projections.

To our knowledge, only one sensitivity analysis has been developed to show the impact of different aerosols emission escenarios in solar potential and wind potential []. Some global simulations from ECHAM5 projected changes in temperature and surface solar radiation globally considering different escenarios of GHG emissions and aerosols emissions. 

Results of this work shows significant positive changes in SSR in the Tropics, at mid and high latitudes, and negative changes in the sub-Tropics in all the 2030 simulations. The extension and intensity of the simulated changes increase as the aerosol emissions decrease, confirming that the climate change signalrelated to GHG increase is augmented by the reduction of anthropogenic aerosols emissions Kloster et al.(2008, 2010).

%{\color{red} wild: A first order estimate of the impact of solar radiation and temperature changes on energy yields of PV systems under the RPC8.5 scenario indicates statistically significant decreases in PV outputs in large parts of the world, but notable exceptions with positive trends in large parts of Europe, South-East of North America and the South-East of China. Projected changes between 2006 and 2049 under the RCP8.5 scenario overall are on the order of 1$%$/decade for horizontal planes, but may be larger for tilted or tracked planes as well as on shorter (decadal) timescales.}

%``The   simulated   changes   in   cloudiness   are   related   to   modifications   in   the   large   scale atmospheric   circulation,   which   are   in   turn   affected   by   the   future   increase   in   global temperature and inter-hemispheric thermal gradient (Gaetani et al. 2014). In boreal summer, an  intensification  of  the  monsoonal  regime  and  associated  cloudiness  over  northern  Africa and  southern  Asia  is  observed,  along  with  a  strengthening  of  the  Hadley  meridional circulation which produces downward vertical motions, and associated subsidence  and clear sky conditions at subtropical latitudes (Figure 2.3) (Gaetani et al. 2014). In boreal winter, the land-sea  thermal  gradient  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  contrasts  the  high  pressure  belt  over the  American  and  Eurasian  continents  with  lows  over  the  Atlantic  and  Pacific  oceans, resulting in a modification of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and associated storm-track.  Specifically,  a  high-low  pressure  dipole  is  forced  in the  Euro-Atlantic  sector,  and  it orientates the westerly flow toward the Scandinavian peninsula, with a consequent excess of cloudiness over the North Atlantic storm-track (Figure 2.3) (Gaetani et al. 2014)''

% ``The anthropogenic aerosols emissions are  assumed  to  follow  the  SRES  storyline;  while  in  the  ECHAM5-HAM  simulations,  a dramatic  abatement  of  anthropogenic  aerosols  emissions  is  assumed,  which  results  in  a stronger   global   warming,   and   consequent   sizeable   modifications   in   the   large   scale atmospheric  circulation  (see  Section  2.3).

% ``The analysis of scenarios indicates a future increase in solar irradiation, although not all scenarios agree in the geographical distribution of this increase. The quality of solar energy resource is projected to increase, mostly due to a decrease in variability. This is an important result, as a more stable inter‐annual resource should decrease the need for backup sources and also reduce inter‐annual electricity price variations. Finally, results from a first approximation to the issue of the ability of solar energy to cover power demand peaks in summer show important differences between regions of the IP. However, the spatially averaged correlation of solar irradiation and summer surface temperatures for the whole IP is rather high, which is a positive result as the strong interconnections of the power grid within the IP could allow a distribution of solar power surpluses in certain regions for such high‐temperature episodes.''

\section{Objectives and scientific questions}%General scientific question: spatiotemporal behaviour of solar resource and photovoltaic production}

%{\color{red} Hay que reescribirlo}

After have introduced the framework, it can be describe the main objective of this work: the underlying idea is to analyse the long-term characteristics of solar resource and photovoltaic production in a relevant area, the Mediterranean region. On one hand, most of the Mediterranean region has high potential of solar resource, which makes the area suitable for its deployment. On the other hand, from the elctrical point of view, Europe is well interconnected and can be considered as a whole system, which is important for the development of distributed energy. In addition, due to the specially high sensitivity to climate change of the Mediterranean area and the projected increase in renewable energy generation characterisation in long time scales becomes an important matter.

We approach the problem in three different chapters. Each one analyses a key aspect of the long-term features of solar resource and photovoltaic production and it is made using different approaches.

\begin{itemize}
\item In the first place, a multi-step scheme for analysing variability over the Iberian Peninsula, IP, is introduced. The selected area contains multiple climates in a relatively small region and its electrical system interconnection is constrain with the rest of the European electrical system. The multi-step scheme includes a regionalizaton step and inter-comparison step, which systematise the variability study. The process can be applied to different spatial or temporal scales.

\item Secondly, the spatial scale is broaden to the Euro-Mediterranean region. In this chapter the influence of aerosols as an specific cause of SSR variability (in space and time) is analysed and how it affects PV production. Other transverse questions can be also studied through this chapter, like the use of RCM for renewable energy resource assessment.

\item Finally, the future of solar resource and photovoltaic potential over the Euro-Mediterranean area is analysed. The evaluation is focused on the role of aerosols in the future runs in different climate models. This chapter allows to investigate not only the possible scenarios for solar resource, but also, it shows the limitations of an ensemble if some sources of uncertainty are not narrowed up.

\end{itemize}  

% En el primer capítulo de resultados se analizará una estrategia para regionalizar una unidad geográfica con coherencia desde el punto de vista eléctrico en fucnión de sus características climáticas. En concreto se estudia la Península Ibérica por ser un sistema ``casi aislado'' de manera natural por las dificultades de interconexión con el resto del continente Europeo. 

% Por otro lado, en el capítulo 6 se estudia el papel de los aerosoles en la variabilidad del recurso y con ello en la producción. La importancia de los aerosoles en escalas climáticas y su impacto geográfico en este capítulo.

% Por último, la importancia de la proyección de los recursos renovables en las condiciones de cambio climático queda reflejada en el capítulo 7 dónde se estudia la posible evolución del recurso solar y el potencial fotovoltaico con respecto a las distintas configuraciones de aerosoles climáticos en los diferentes modelos regionales analizados.
