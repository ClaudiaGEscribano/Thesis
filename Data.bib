abstract = {The statistics of hourly global radiation are analysed for various climates and locations, at time scales ranging from one month to one hour. The probabilistic and sequential properties of the hourly clearness index ktare related with a variety of parameters, including the daily clearness index Ktand the solar altitude angle h, thereby displaying the nonstationary and time-inhomogeneous nature of hourly radiation. Analytical expressions for the probability distribution of ktare proposed (truncated Gaussian functions depending on Ktand h). The results reported in this paper provide a deeper understanding of hourly solar radiation statistics, and explain some of the features displayed by radiation data at longer time scales. From the practical point of view they have implications, for example, for the construction of models for generating synthetic radiation data, an important and often indispensable tool for designing and simulating solar systems. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) sensitivity to eight different combinations of cumulus, microphysics, and planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes over a topographically complex region in southern Spain (Andalusia) for the period 1990–99. The WRF configuration consisted of a 10-km-resolution domain nested in a coarser domain driven by 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data, with spectral nudging above the PBL employed over the latter domain. The model outputs have been compared at different time scales with an observational dataset that comprises 438 rain gauges and 152 temperature stations with records of both daily maximum and minimum temperatures. To reduce the ‘‘representation error,'' the validation with observations has been performed using a multistep regionalization that distinguishes five precipitation regions and four temperature regions. The analysis proves that both cumulus and PBL schemes have a crucial impact on the description of precipitation in Andalusia, whereas no noticeable differences between microphysics options were appreciated. Temperature is described similarly by all the configurations, except for the PBL choice affecting minimum values. WRF provides a definite improvement over ERA-40 in the climate description in terms of frequency, spatial distribution, and intensity of extreme events. It also captures more accurately the annual cycle and reduces the biases and the RMSE for monthly precipitation, whereas only a minor enhancement of these features was obtained for monthly-mean maximum and minimum temperatures. The results indicate that WRF is able to correctly reproduce Andalusian climate and produces useful added-value information for climate studies.},

New challenges, arising from the variable nature of solar energy generation, must be tackled in order to keep a stable and balanced power grid. In this study, short term variability in power output due to changing intensity due to cloud cover is assessed for its impact on energy delivery. Studies on this subject conclude that while there may be local variability, there is a strong reduction in that variability when the aggregate of several PV systems is taken into account, rather than just one PV system. The analysis shows that the aggregated effect of many geographically dispersed systems PV systems yields a smoothing effect that reduces the impact of local variability.},

The very simple clear sky models do not require meteorological data while the very simple cloudy sky models need only data on the total cloud amount. Three slightly more complex cloudy sky models which use additional meteorological inputs were also tested. The mean absolute error of the very simple clear sky models varies between 7 and 14{\%} in July and between 12 and 19{\%} in January. The best model originates from Western Europe. The performance of the very simple cloudy sky models is comparable to that of the more complicated ones. This is the main conclusion of the paper. Generally, their root mean square error varies between 35 and 45{\%} in close agreement with results from the literature. Twelve classes of daily average cloudiness were defined. The model accuracy is better for the first six classes (with smaller cloud amount) and worse for the other six classes.},

abstract = {The objective of the present work is to compare the projections of surface solar radiation (SSR) simulated by four regional climate models (CCLM, RCA4, WRF, ALADIN) with the respective fields of their ten driving CMIP5 global climate models. First the annual and seasonal SSR changes are examined in the regional and in the global climate models based on the RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The results show significant discrepancies between the projected SSR, the multi-model mean of RCMs indicates a decrease in SSR of −0.60 W/m2 per decade over Europe, while the multi-model mean of the associated GCMs used to drive the RCMs gives an increase in SSR of +0.39 W/m2 per decade for the period of 2006--2100 over Europe. At seasonal scale the largest differences appear in spring and summer. The different signs of SSR projected changes can be interpreted as the consequence of the different behavior of cloud cover in global and regional climate models. Cloudiness shows a significant decline in GCMs with −0.24{\%} per decade which explains the extra income in SSR, while in case of the regional models no significant changes in cloudiness can be detected. The reduction of SSR in RCMs can be attributed to increasing atmospheric absorption in line with the increase of water vapor content. Both global and regional models overestimate SSR in absolute terms as compared to surface observations, in line with an underestimation of cloud cover. Regional models further have difficulties to adequately reproduce the observed trends in SSR over the past decades.},

abstract = {The combination of hydroelectric and photovoltaic sources of energy in a generation system may seem unfeasible due to the still quite high costs of the photovoltaic plants. However in the next few decades, significant reductions in those costs are to be expected. Moreover, this combination may reduce the cost of plants implemented in low hydroelectric potential sites for which main system interconnection costs prove prohibitive. The study of hybrid hydro-PV generating plants allows the evaluation of the use of water reservoirs and battery banks as alternatives for energy storage within a system. It also allows the evaluation of the advantages of generation from complementary energy sources. The objectives of this paper is to propose the concept of a theoretical performance limit for the plants and propose a method for the determination of this performance limit using computer simulations with idealized energy availability functions. Using this method, the effect of different degrees of complementarity in time of the energy resources on the performance of hydro PV plants is studied. It has been observed that, as expected, the smallest failure indexes measuring the energy supply to the consumers are associated to the best complementarity in time indexes. The results of the simulations led to the synthesis of failure index curves, as functions of the different degrees of complementarity in time, with data obtained solely with the utilization of idealized functions describing the energy availabilities, as proposed in this work. The results so obtained are a preliminary set treating the influence of the complementarity characteristics on the performance of hybrid plants based on hydro and solar energies and show how the complementarity characteristics may be used to design hybrid power generation systems showing improved efficiency. The subsequent research work shall proceed to at least two different phases. In the first one, the method exposed in the present work shall be applied to real data and compared to the operation of existing hydro PV plants. In the second phase the obtained relations of the performance of the system to the different degrees of complementarity shall be confronted with design parameters of hydroelectric-photovoltaic plants based on complementary resources. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report two human factors studies performed to investigate human performance in tasks involving dextrous manipulations of virtual objects with haptic feedback. These studies were performed at the Man-Machine Interface Laboratory (Rutgers University, NJ, USA) and at the Laboratoire de Robotique de Paris (CRIIF-LRP). Different haptic devices were used : the Rutgers Master, the LRP Force Feedback Glove (LRP), and the ITR device (Interface Technology Research, UK). These experiments involved (1) accurate placements of virtual objects and (2) grasping-force regulation. In the former case, we compared the LRP FFG (that provides complex haptic cueing) and the ITR device(that provides binary haptic cueing : grasped/not grasped). In the latter case, we investigated the effect of sensory substitution (synesthetic representation of haptic informations) to convey virtual haptic cues using the visual and auditory sensory channels. Results of the experiments showed that (1) information redundancy (display of visual or auditory force feedback in addition to finger force feedback) allowed to increase performance compared to finger force feedback alone, and (2) simple tactual feedback (provided by the ITR device) allowed similar performance than complex force feedback (provided by the LRP FFG). This result led us to think that complex force feedback cues are not required in simple manipulation task (i.e. when grasping regulation forces is not crucial). In this case binary haptic information could be sufficient},

abstract = {A review of more than 60 studies (plus m4ore than 65 studies on P2G) on power and energy models based on simulation and optimization was done. Based on these, for power systems with up to 95{\%} renewables, the electricity storage size is found to be below 1.5{\%} of the annual demand (in energy terms). While for 100{\%} renewables energy systems (power, heat, mobility), it can remain below 6{\%} of the annual energy demand. Combination of sectors and diverting the electricity to another sector can play a large role in reducing the storage size. From the potential alternatives to satisfy this demand, pumped hydro storage (PHS) global potential is not enough and new technologies with a higher energy density are needed. Hydrogen, with more than 250 times the energy density of PHS is a potential option to satisfy the storage need. However, changes needed in infrastructure to deal with high hydrogen content and the suitability of salt caverns for its storage can pose limitations for this technology. Power to Gas (P2G) arises as possible alternative overcoming both the facilities and the energy density issues. The global storage requirement would represent only 2{\%} of the global annual natural gas production or 10{\%} of the gas storage facilities (in energy equivalent). The more options considered to deal with intermittent sources, the lower the storage requirement will be. Therefore, future studies aiming to quantify storage needs should focus on the entire energy system including technology vectors (e.g. Power to Heat, Liquid, Gas, Chemicals) to avoid overestimating the amount of storage needed.},

It reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek et al. (l951a), is constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by applying the criterion of minimum within-cluster sum of squares. This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a "variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by using the agglomerative method of Ward (1963) and the divisive method of Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).},

Employing a novel approach based on the timing of extreme precipitation events a number of physically consistent subregions are defined. The comparison of different diagnostics over the Mediterranean domain and physically homogeneous sub-domains is presented and discussed, focussing on the relative impact of several model configuration features (resolution, coupling, physical parameterisations) on the performance in reproducing extreme precipitation events. It is found that the agreement between the observed and modelled long-term statistics of extreme precipitation is more sensitive to the model physics, in particular convective parameterisation, than to other model configurations such as resolution and coupling.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the spatial and temporal changes in sunshine duration (SunDu) and total cloud cover (TCC) over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and four subregions during 1961-2004 using high-quality, homogenized data sets. The analyses confirm that over most of the IP and in most seasons, SunDu and TCC variations are strongly negatively correlated, with absolute values ∼0.8-0.9. Somewhat weaker correlations (0.5-0.6) are found in the southern portion of the IP in summer. A large discrepancy between the SunDu and TCC records occurs from the 1960s until the early 1980s when the SunDu series shows a decrease that it is not associated with an increase in TCC. This negative trend or "dimming" is even more pronounced after removing the effects of TCC via linear regression. Since the early 1980s, the SunDu and TCC residual SunDu series exhibit an upward trend or "brightening." In addition to the long-term dimming and brightening, the volcanic eruptions of El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo are clearly evident in the TCC residual SunDu record. The TCC and SunDu records over the IP are well correlated with sea level pressure (SLP), with above normal TCC and below normal SunDu corresponding to below normal SLP locally in all seasons. The TCC and SunDu related SLP changes over the IP in winter and spring are part of a larger-scale north-south dipole pattern that extends over the entire Euro-Atlantic sector. Other more regional atmospheric circulation, patterns, identified from rotated principal component analysis, are also linked to TCC and SunDu variations over the IP. Finally and perhaps surprisingly, the TCC residual SunDu series exhibits a statistically significant relationship with a regional atmospheric circulation pattern during spring, summer, and autumn.

abstract = {This study is an analysis of the seasonal all-sky surface solar radiation variability in Europe during 19702000 using surface observations from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA). On the basis of the annual means period 19701985, there is a statistically significant decline of 3.0{\%} decade1 (3.8 Wm2 decade1) followed by a nonsignificant rise of 0.3{\%} decade1 (0.4 Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. The behavior of the solar radiation for spring is similar to the annual series and has the strongest increase of 1.6{\%} decade1 (2.5 Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. In summer a similar evolution to the annual and spring time series is shown but has a stronger decline of 3.2{\%} decade1 (6.8 Wm2 decade1) during 19701985. A small positive nonsignificant trend is reported for the winter means time series while a statistically significant negative trend of 2.5{\%} decade1 (2.1 Wm2 decade1) was found in autumn during 19702000. By comparing variations in all-sky solar radiation with changes in cloud cover and NAO, we attribute the winter and autumn trends mainly to the NAO through the modification of mid-to-low cloud cover in southern Europe and the spring and summer trends to mid-to-low cloud cover in northern Europe. However, because the cloud cover and solar radiation relationship weakens in the low-frequency variability, it suggests that other effects such as aerosols may also play a role. In addition, aerosols could be interfering with the relationship between solar radiation and NAO, contributing to a strengthening of their correlation in the low-frequency variability during winter and autumn.},

We work in a perfect-model approach where the LAM is driven by a general circulation model (GCM) run at the same resolution and sharing the same physics and dynamics as the LAM. A set of three 50 km resolution simulations run over Western Europe with the LAM ALADIN-Climate and the GCM ARPEGE-Climate are performed to address this issue. Results are consistent with previous studies regarding the seasonal-mean fields. Furthermore, they show that neither the use of the spectral nudging nor the choice of a small domain are detrimental to the modelling of heavy precipitation in the present experiment.},

abstract = {The correlations of Hottel, Whillier, Liu and Jordan between diffuse and hemispherical, and between instantaneous (hourly) values and daily totals of solar radiation are recalibrated against pyrheliometer data for five stations in the U.S. The validity of the Liu and Jordan approach is confirmed, and numerical inaccuracies of the original correlations are found to arise from three factors: (i) reliance on uncorrected measurements of diffuse insolation with pyranometer plus shade ring, (ii) use of a single value of extraterrestrial insolation for a whole month, and (iii) neglect of seasonal variations in the diffuse/hemispherical ratio. The new correlation for the daily total ratio of diffuse over hemispherical insolation agrees with results reported for India, Israel and Canada which included the shade ring correction. This suggests that latitude independence is a good approximation. The new correlations imply that the diffuse component is significantly larger than that predicted by the original formulas of Liu and Jordan. Analytical expressions are presented the parameters of which are obtained by a least squares fit to the data. The resulting formulas provide a complete description of the long term average insolation incident on surfaces of arbitrary orientation; the only meteorological input is the long term average daily total of hemispherical insolation on the horizontal surface. Comparison between model and data shows an accuracy better than 3 per cent for the long term average insolation available to solar correctors, both fixed and tracking. The model provides a framework for optimal matching between solar radiation and ideal concentrators (based on the principle of phase space conservation). In addition to computing radiation availability for solar collectors, the model can be used for calculating heating and cooling loads of buildings. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

ST and MOS are tested for the University of Rome “Tor Vergata” site. The models are trained and validated using one year data. Through a cross training procedure, the dependence of the models on the training year is also analyzed. The performance of ST, NWP and MOS models, together with the benchmark Persistence Model (PM), are compared. The ST model and the NWP model exhibit similar results. Nevertheless different sources of forecast errors between ST and NWP models are identified.

abstract = {Building large solar power plants requires significant long-term investment so understanding impacts from climate change will aid financial planning, technology selection, and energy output projections. In this article we examine how projected changes in temperature and insolation over the 21st century will affect photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) output. Projected climate data was obtained from the coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models HadGEM1 and HadCM3 under the IPCC SRES A1B scenario which describes a future world of rapid economic growth with a balanced use of renewable and fossil fuel power generation. Our calculations indicate that under this scenario PV output from 2010 to 2080 is likely to increase by a few percent in Europe and China, see little change in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. CSP output is likely to increase by more than 10{\%} in Europe, increase by several percent in China and a few percent in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. The results are robust to uncertainty in projected temperature change. A qualitative analysis of uncertainty in projected insolation change suggests strongest confidence in the results for Europe and least confidence in the results for western USA. Changes in PV and CSP output are further studied by calculating fractional contributions from changes in temperature and insolation. For PV there is considerable variation in contribution depending on location. For CSP the contribution from changes in insolation is always dominant.},

Solar power forecasting is then necessary to better exploit this variability and to increase the penetration of photovoltaic power into the energy mix. Solar energy forecasting involves prediction of cloud property above a given point. For several hour ahead forecasts, using images from meteorological geostationary satellite is the most suitable solution. We propose a forecasting method based on a phase correlation algorithm for motion estimation between subsequent cloud maps derived from Meteosat-9 images. The method is assessed against state-of-the-art over a limited area over South of France for a 4-hour period. Cloud index maps are predicted. Our forecasting are 21 {\%} better than persistence in relative RMSE of cloud index. If state-of-the-art shows better results (23 {\%}), our algorithm reduces computing of 25 {\%} and then minimize operational solar forecasting constraints.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic production is mostly driven by the solar irradiance received at ground level. Forecasting surface solar irradiance remains to predict the cloudiness and combine it with the value of the irradiance modeled under a clear sky for the same area at the same forecast horizon. Thus, uncertainty of irradiance under clear sky can affect significantly the photovoltaic production forecast. Clear sky irradiance can be accurately computed if concentration of some atmospheric components (aerosol, water vapor and ozone) are sufficiently known above a location. Many clear sky models have been designed allowing a various number of inputs. In this work, we analyzed the performance of four different clear sky models. We compared their outputs against ground measurements located in Reunion Island, Corsica and French Guiana. We used the models with atmospheric parameters provided by two different sources (neighboring ground measurements and reanalysis). Best results lead to a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 3 {\%} and an absolute relative mean bias error (rMBE) less than 1 {\%}, for minutely irradiance. Using atmospheric parameters from reanalysis instead of punctual measurements significantly reduces errors in clear sky models.},

abstract = {Within Task IX of the International Energy's Solar Heating and Cooling Programme, 12 models which simulate solar irradiance on horizontal surfaces were evaluated with data from seven countries. This paper presents the results of this study. Simple, widely applicable models were considered which use standard meteorological observations. Two models use cloud layer amount and type, three use total cloud amount, four use fractional sunshine, while the remaining four models partition measured global irradiation into direct beam and diffuse components. Data from 15 stations were used; four Australian, four European, three Canadian, and four American. In most cases three years of data were used for each station. Cloudiness regimes from relatively cloud free (Australia and Albuquerque) to relatively cloudy (European stations) were represented. Model performance was assessed from the mean bias error (MBE), the mean absolute error (MAB) and the root mean square error (RMSE). Quantitative ranking of models from these measures showed that cloud layer models provided the best global irradiation estimates (MBE {\textless} |0.2|; RMSE {\textless} 2.1 MJ/m2/day) and the partitioning models the best direct beam and diffuse irradiation estimates (MBE {\textless} |0.6|; RMSE {\textless} 1.6 MJ/m2day). However, RMSE results for 30-day means showed that layer models performed as well as the partitioning models for direct beam and diffuse irradiation. The performance of the better models showed little variation with either season or cloud cover: thus, they seem to be generally applicable. The performance of the better global irradiation models is probably limited more by inadequate meteorological measurements and observations than by defects in the models themselves.},

abstract = {Australia has an abundant solar energy resource that is likely to be used for energy generation on a large scale. Variable sources of electricity generation require knowledge of the nature of their variability at all time scales. This study examines the effect that El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have on solar radiation in Australia, in order to establish the role for seasonal forecasting of solar power. Calendar years are classified into their ENSO state using a sea surface temperature index. The ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis products are then used to estimate the effect of ENSO on global horizontal solar irradiance over the continent. A bootstrap technique is used to obtain confidence regions for the effect in both winter and summer. The main impact of ENSO occurs during winter over a large part of eastern Australia. Little impact was observed over the continent during summer. A similar analysis is conducted for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) to ensure that the observed ENSO effect is not a manifestation of the IOD. This study indicates that the ENSO phenomenon may account for solar energy changes of more than 10{\%} in some locations on a seasonal basis. We show that the solar radiation analysis is directly applicable to solar energy yield. Knowledge of this variability may influence the location of large solar generation plants. Also, there is a potential to predict solar energy a few months ahead by means of seasonal forecasting systems, which would help to assist with planning for electricity grid. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Med-CORDEX simulations over the period 1979--2011 are evaluated with regard to their capability to represent observed decadal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region and improve upon previous generation simulations from the ENSEMBLES project in their various experimental set-ups. Such an evaluation is needed to inform the use of these simulations and also future model development. For temperature, both Med-CORDEX and ENSEMBLES simulations tend to provide comparable results: they generally capture the sign and timing of the anomalies but not the amplitude. In general, no clear stratification appears when considering different types of Med-CORDEX regional modeling systems. Rather, it is remarkable that certain periods are poorly represented by all systems with a general underestimation of the observed long-term temperature trend, mostly in the summer season, even with respect to the corresponding global drivers. For precipitation, the Med-CORDEX simulations are closer to observations than the other datasets, with some improvement with respect to ENSEMBLES dataset. In general, all the systems experience difficulties in representing anomalies during specific periods or for specific regions. These appear in part due to limitations in the reanalysis boundary forcing data. For instance, in the second part of 1980s, the spatial patterns of surface air temperature during DJF/MAM are generally poorly represented, as well as the regionally averaged MAM/JJA surface air temperature decadal anomalies. Overall, the evaluation suggests limited improvement in Med-CORDEX simulations compared to ENSEMBLES, and a lack of sensitivity to resolution or coupling configuration, with persisting problems in part likely related to the representation of surface processes that could also affect the viability of future projections (e.g. the estimation of temperature trends). A set of decadal variability evaluation metrics, as applied in this study, could be useful in the context of a broader evaluation framework.},

Our risk measure is based on the probability of a production deficit, in a manner akin to the value-at-risk, simulation analysis of financial portfolios. We examine whether the risk level of a mixed hydro-and-wind portfolio of generating assets improves on the risk of an all-hydro portfolio, by relaxing the dependence on water inflows and attenuating the impact of droughts. Copulas are used to model the dependence between the two sources of energy. The data considered, over the period 1958-2003, are for the province of Qu{\'{e}}bec, which possesses large hydro and wind resources.

These results indicate that unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning. Several implications are discussed. On dimension reduction, the result provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data reductions, beyond the conventional noisereduction explanation that PCA, via singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear approximation of the data. On learning, the result suggests effective techniques for K-means data clustering. DNA gene expression and Internet newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results.

High penetration of such energy sources might be facilitated by using their complementarity in order to increase the balance between energy load and generation. This study presents the analysis of the effect of a 100{\%} renewable energy mix composed by solar and run-of-the-river energy in Northern Italy where these two energy sources are the main alternative energy sources. Along a climate gradient from the Alpine crest (snow melt dominated area) to the Veneto plain (rainfall dominated area), solar power is generated in the flat plain, and run-of-the-river hydropower at two mountainous locations. Covering all possible mixes of these two sources, we analyze their complementarity across different temporal scales using two indicators: the standard deviation of the energy balance and the theoretical storage required for balancing generation and load. Results show that at small temporal scale (hourly), a high share of run-of-the-river power allows minimizing the energy balance variability. The opposite is obtained at larger temporal scales (daily and monthly) essentially because of lower variability of solar power generation, which also implies a lower storage requirement.},

Seven RCMs are considered, five of which were also coupled with an oceanic model. All simulations were forced at the lateral boundaries by the ERA-Interim reanalysis for a common 20-year period (1989--2008). Six different cyclone tracking methods have been applied to all twelve RCM simulations and to the ERA-Interim reanalysis in order to assess the RCMs from the perspective of different cyclone definitions. All RCMs reproduce the main areas of high cyclone occurrence in the region south of the Alps, in the Adriatic, Ionian and Aegean Seas, as well as in the areas close to Cyprus and to Atlas mountains. The RCMs tend to underestimate intense cyclone occurrences over the Mediterranean Sea and reproduce 24--40 {\{}{\%}{\}} of these systems, as identified in the reanalysis. The use of grid nudging in one of the RCMs is shown to be beneficial, reproducing about 60 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the intense cyclones and keeping a better track of the seasonal cycle of intense cyclogenesis. Finally, the most intense cyclones tend to be similarly reproduced in coupled and uncoupled model simulations, suggesting that modeling atmosphere--ocean coupled processes has only a weak impact on the climatology and intensity of Mediterranean cyclones.},

abstract = {Medicanes are cyclones over the Mediterranean Sea having a tropical-like structure but a rather small size, that can produce significant damage due to the combination of intense winds and heavy precipitation. Future climate projections, performed generally with individual atmospheric climate models, indicate that the intensity of the medicanes could increase under climate change conditions. The availability of large ensembles of high resolution and ocean--atmosphere coupled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, performed in MedCORDEX and EURO-CORDEX projects, represents an opportunity to improve the assessment of the impact of climate change on medicanes. As a first step towards such an improved assessment, we analyze the ability of the RCMs used in these projects to reproduce the observed characteristics of medicanes, and the impact of increased resolution and air-sea coupling on their simulation. In these storms, air-sea interaction plays a fundamental role in their formation and intensification, a different mechanism from that of extra-tropical cyclones, where the baroclinic instability mechanism prevails. An observational database, based on satellite images combined with high resolution simulations (Miglietta et al. in Geophys Res Lett 40:2400--2405, 2013), is used as a reference for evaluating the simulations. In general, the simulated medicanes do not coincide on a case-by-case basis with the observed medicanes. However, observed medicanes with a high intensity and relatively long duration of tropical characteristics are better replicated in simulations. The observed spatial distribution of medicanes is generally well simulated, while the monthly distribution reveals the difficulty of simulating the medicanes that first appear in September after the summer minimum in occurrence. Increasing the horizontal resolution has a systematic and generally positive impact on the frequency of simulated medicanes, while the general underestimation of their intensity is not corrected in most cases. The capacity of a few models to better simulate the medicane intensity suggests that the model formulation is more important than reducing the grid spacing alone. A negative intensity feedback is frequently the result of air-sea interaction for tropical cyclones in other basins. The introduction of air-sea coupling in the present simulations has an overall limited impact on medicane frequency and intensity, but it produces an interesting seasonal shift of the simulated medicanes from autumn to winter. This fact, together with the analysis of two contrasting particular cases, indicates that the negative feedback could be limited or even absent in certain situations. We suggest that the effects of air-sea interaction on medicanes may depend on the oceanic mixed layer depth, thus increasing the applicability of ocean--atmosphere coupled RCMs for climate change analysis of this kind of cyclones.},

abstract = {Wind energy is susceptible to global climate change because it could alter the wind patterns. Then, improvement of our knowledge of wind field variability is crucial to optimize the use of wind resources in a given region. Here, we quantify the effects of climate change on the surface wind speed field over the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands using an ensemble of four regional climate models driven by a global climate model. Regions of the Iberian Peninsula with coherent temporal variability in wind speed in each of the models are identified and analysed using cluster analysis. These regions are continuous in each model and exhibit a high degree of overlap across the models. The models forced by the European Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) reanalysis are validated against the European Climate Assessment and Dataset wind. We find that regional models are able to simulate with reasonable skill the spatial distribution of wind speed at 10 m in the Iberian Peninsula, identifying areas with common wind variability. Under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B climate change scenario, the wind speed in the identified regions for 2031–2050 is up to 5{\%} less than during the 1980–1999 control period for all models. The models also agree on the time evolution of spatially averaged wind speed in each region, showing a negative trend for all of them. These tendencies depend on the region and are significant at p = 5{\%} or slightly more for annual trends, while seasonal trends are not significant in most of the regions and seasons.

abstract = {The intrinsic performance of 18 broadband radiative models is assessed, using high-quality datasets from five sites in widely different climates. The selected models can predict direct, diffuse and global irradiances under clear skies from atmospheric data, and have all been (or still are) involved in large-scale applications, for instance to prepare solar resource maps and datasets, or to evaluate solar radiation in GIS software. The input data to the models include accurate aerosol and water vapor measurements by collocated sunphotometers, if needed. Cloud occurrences are meticulously scrutinized through the use of various tools to avoid cloud contamination of the test data. The intrinsic performance of the models is evaluated by comparison between their predictions and measurements at high frequency (1-minute time step at four sites, 3-minute at one site). The total expanded uncertainty of these measurements is estimated at 3{\%} for direct irradiance, and 5{\%} for diffuse and global irradiance.Various statistics are calculated to evaluate the systematic and random differences between the data series, as well as the agreement between the cumulative distribution functions. In the latter case, stringent statistics based on the Komolgorov-Smirnov (KS) test are used. Large differences in performance are apparent between models. Those that require more atmospheric inputs perform usually better than simpler models. Whereas many models can predict the global horizontal irradiance within uncertainty limits similar to those of the radiation measurements, the prediction of direct irradiance is less accurate. Moreover, the prediction of diffuse horizontal irradiance is particularly deficient in most models. The cumulative distribution functions also denote areas of concern.A ranking of all models is proposed, based on four statistical indicators: mean bias difference (MBD), root mean square difference (RMSD), total uncertainty with 95{\%} confidence limits (U 95), and the newly introduced Combined Performance Index (CPI), which optimally combines two KS indices with RMSD. For direct irradiance, consistently high rankings are obtained with five models (REST2, Ineichen, Hoyt, Bird, and Iqbal-C, in decreasing order of performance) that require a relatively large number of atmospheric inputs. The inferior performance of models requiring little or no atmospheric inputs suggests that large-scale solar resource products derived from them may be inappropriate for serious solar applications. Additionally, prediction uncertainties under ideal clear-sky conditions can propagate and affect all-sky predictions as well-resulting in potential biases in existing solar resource maps at the continent scale, for instance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is responding to a growing demand for high-accuracy solar resource data with uncertainties significantly lower than those of existing solar resource datasets, such as the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Measurements for long-term solar resource characterizations require years to complete, which is an unacceptable timeline for the rapidly emerging needs of renewable energy applications. This contribution seeks methods of reducing the uncertainty of existing long-term solar resource datasets by incorporating lower-uncertainty site-specific ground measurements of a limited period of record. In particular, various techniques are being explored to make full use of the existing high-resolution radiation data available in the NSRDB and other sources, and extrapolate them over time using locally measured data and other supportive information. The interannual variability in global and direct radiation is studied here using long-term data at various sites. NSRDB's modeled data for the 1998-2005 period are compared to quality-controlled measurements to assess the performance of the model, which is found to vary greatly depending on climatic condition. The reported results are encouraging for applications involving concentrators at very sunny sites. Large seasonal biases are found at some cloudy sites. Various improvements are proposed to enhance the quality of the existing model and modeled data. The measurement of solar radiation to characterize the solar climate for renewable energy and other applications is a time consuming and expensive operation. Full climate characterization may require several decades of measurements-a prospect that is not practical for an industry intent on rapid deployment of solar technologies. This study demonstrates that the consistency of the solar resource in both time and space varies widely across the United States. The mapped results here illustrate regions with high and low variability and provide readers with quick visual information to help them decide where and how long measurements should be taken for a particular application. The underlying data that form these maps are also available from NREL to provide users the opportunity for more detailed analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

@article{Gutierrez2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Renewable energy resources are variable by nature. Due to this fact conventional electricity systems, which were designed for centralized generation, have to follow a different management approach when a big share of these technologies take part into the system. The space-time variability characteristics of solar radiation, wind and precipitation are very different and a detailed understanding of them is important for an adequate planning and management of the electricity system. This paper is focused on solar irradiation as source of energy for photovoltaic (PV) generation, but the proposed scheme can generally be applied to other renewable resources and different solar irradiation applications. A comprehensive methodology to analyze variability and complementarity of solar resource and PV production among sub-regions of a wide area is developed. The photovoltaic energy yield is defined as kWh per kW installed, which facilitates the comparison among sub-regions and allows a comparison with other renewable energies like solar thermoelectric or wind energy. The multi-step approach facilitates the spatial evaluation and comparison among areas and it could be applied to different time resolutions, from a short term analysis to climatological perspective as well as a climate change projections analysis. The main steps of the method are the application of an objective clustering method for performing a regionalization of the whole domain, the ana lysis of the temporal variability of solar radiation and photovoltaic energy yield, and the intercomparison of the obtained clusters for examining their complementarity. As an implementation example, we make use of 30 years of daily satellite data, which is usually considered as the time for defining a climatology, and a long-term overview of solar variability is analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). In this region, the internal interconnections of the electrical system are strong, but the external interconnections are rather limited. The spatial distribution and variability of photovoltaic (PV) power yield is calculated for different tracking systems. The variability is analyzed on an interannual time scale, which is relevant for energy supply security and year-to-year price stability. The interannual variability shows robustness and stability of solar radiation and PV production on average for the whole domain, but with significant differences among clusters that could allow spatial compensation of PV production. The relationship between the variability of solar irradiation and of PV yield is not uniform among the different clusters. Areas where solar irradiation is higher are more sensitive to tracking type. The whole process described in the article provides the information of how solar resource and the PV energy yield perform in a limited area and provide the tools to analyze the relationships between sub-areas and their variability. In this sense, this method can be applied for isolated or nearly isolated electric systems located in regions with a variety of climates, or for interconnected systems involving several countries.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the Mediterranean Sea heat budget components from a set of forced and coupled simulations performed in the frame of the Med-CORDEX project. The simulations use regional climate system models (RCSMs) dedicated to the Mediterranean area and driven by the ERA40/ERA-Interim reanalyses. The study focuses on the period 1980--2010. Interannual variations of the average net heat flux at the sea surface are consistent among models but the spread in the mean values is large (from −4.8 to +2.2 Wm−2) with the coupled models showing the lowest heat loss from the sea. For the heat flux at the Strait of Gibraltar both interannual variations and mean values show a large intermodel spread. The basin average temperature shows positive trends with highest values in the coupled models; it also shows interannual variations that are in good agreement with observations. The heat content rate is calculated based on the derivative of the average temperature and is found to be significantly correlated for most models with the net heat flux at the sea surface (average correlation {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.5) but not with the net heat flux through the Strait of Gibraltar (average correlation {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.2), suggesting that in the considered RCSMs the interannual variability of the heat content rate is mainly driven by the surface heat fluxes. The resemblance between the simulated and observed heat content rates is stronger in the forced models than in the coupled ones. This is explained by the stronger constraint applied to the forced models by the use of the surface temperature relaxation to observations. The temperature of the outflowing water through the Strait of Gibraltar shows positive and significant trends, also higher in the coupled models. It is suggested that the Mediterranean Sea warming found in most models and in particular in the coupled ones, induces a change of the hydrographic conditions that affects the Strait of Gibraltar.},

This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.},

abstract = {In Ontario (Canada), the integration of renewable power is a priority policy goal. Since 2004, the circumstances under which the integration of renewable power is evaluated have changed due to successive changes in price as well as concerns that its over-production may add to grid congestion. This research investigates the value of increasing complementarity (both proximate and geographically dispersed) of wind and solar resources as a means by which electricity planners and researchers might advance electricity sustainability in Ontario. More specifically, this paper asks the following questions: 1) Does the combination of solar and wind resources in selected locations in Ontario serve to ‘smooth out' power production, i.e., decrease instances of both high and low values, as compared to either resource producing individually? 2) Can this ‘smoothness' be further improved by dispersing these resources geographically amongst locations? and 3) Does increasing the number of locations with solar and wind resources further ‘smooth out' power production? Three years (2003–2005) of synchronous, hourly measurements of solar irradiance and wind speeds from Environment Canada's Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) are used to derive dimensionless indices for four locations in Ontario (Toronto, Wiarton, Sault Ste. Marie and Ottawa). These indices are used to develop three transparent and accessible methods of analysis: (1) graphical representation; (2) percentile ranking; and (3) using a theoretical maximum as a proxy for capacity. The article concludes that the combination of solar and wind within locations and amongst two locations improves ‘smoothness' in power production, as compared to when each resource is produced on its own; moreover, it is further improved once more than two resources and two locations are combined. However, there is neither further benefit, nor drawback, associated with the geographic dispersion of complementarity between solar in one location and wind in another, when compared to both resources in one location.},

Solar generation technologies have experienced strong energy market growth in the past few years, with corresponding increase in local grid penetration rates. As is the case with wind, the solar resource at the ground level is highly variable mostly due to cloud cover variability, atmospheric aerosol levels, and indirectly and to a lesser extent, participating gases in the atmosphere. The inherent variability of solar generation at higher grid penetration levels poses problems associated with the cost of reserves, dispatchable and ancillary generation, and grid reliability in general. As a result, high accuracy forecast systems are required for multiple time horizons that are associated with regulation, dispatching, scheduling and unit commitment. Here we review the theory behind these forecasting methodologies, and a number of successful applications of solar forecasting methods for both the solar resource and the power output of solar plants at the utility scale level.},

abstract = {Renewable energies arise as part of both economic development plans and mitigation strategies aimed at abating climate change. Contrariwise, most renewable energies are potentially vulnerable to climate change, which could affect in particular solar and wind power. Proper evaluations of this two-way climate-renewable energy relationship require detailed information of the geographical location of the renewable energy fleets. However, this information is usually provided as total amounts installed per administrative region, especially with respect to future planned installations. To help overcome this limiting issue, the objective of this contribution was to develop the so-called CLIMIX model: a tool that performs a realistic spatial allocation of given amounts of both photovoltaic (PV) and wind power installed capacities and evaluates the energy generated under varying climate conditions. This is done over a regular grid so that the created scenarios can be directly used in conjunction with outputs of climate models. First, we used the 0.44° resolution grid defined for the EURO-CORDEX project and applied the CLIMIX model to spatially allocate total amounts of both unreported 2012 and future 2020 PV and wind power installations in Europe at the country level. Second, we performed a validation exercise using the various options for estimating PV and wind power production under the created scenarios that are included in the model. The results revealed an acceptable agreement between the estimated and the recorded power production values in every European country. Lastly, we estimated increases in power production derived from the future deployment of new renewable units, often obtaining non-direct relationships. This latter further emphasizes the need of accurate spatially-resolved PV and wind power scenarios in order to perform reliable estimations of power production.},

abstract = {Europe is investing considerably in renewable energies for a sustainable future, with both Iberian countries (Portugal and Spain) promoting significantly new hydropower, wind, and solar plants. The climate variability in this area is highly controlled by just a few large-scale teleconnection modes. However, the relationship between these modes and the renewable climate-dependent energy resources has not yet been established in detail. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the interannual variability of the main and primary renewable energy resources in Iberia. This is achieved through a holistic assessment that is based on a 10-km-resolution climate simulation spanning the period 1959–2007 that provides physically consistent data of the various magnitudes involved. A monthly analysis for the ex- tended winter (October–March) months shows that negativeNAOphases enhance wind speeds (10{\%}–15{\%}) and, thereby, wind power (estimated around 30{\%} at typical wind-turbine altitudes) and hydropower re- sources (with changes in precipitation exceeding 100{\%} and implying prolonged responses in reservoir storage and release throughout the year), while diminishing the solar potential (10{\%}–20{\%}). Opposite signals were also sporadically identified, being well explained when taking into account the orography and the prevailing wind direction during bothNAOphases.Anadditional analysis using real wind, hydropower, and solar power generation data further confirms the strong signature of the NAO.},

Res. Lett. 8 044035 Abstract The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA) and the Scandinavian (SCAND) modes are the three main large-scale circulation patterns driving the climate variability of the Iberian Peninsula. This study assesses their influence in terms of solar (photovoltaic) and wind power generation potential (SP and WP) and evaluates their skill as predictors. For that we use a hindcast regional climate simulation to retrieve the primary meteorological variables involved, surface solar radiation and wind speed. First we identify that the maximum influence of the various modes occurs on the interannual variations of the monthly mean SP and WP series, being generally more relevant in winter. Second we find that in this time-scale and season, SP (WP) varies up to 30{\%} (40{\%}) with respect to the mean climatology between years with opposite phases of the modes, although the strength and the spatial distribution of the signals differ from one month to another. Last, the skill of a multi-linear regression model (MLRM), built using the NAO, EA and SCAND indices, to reconstruct the original wintertime monthly series of SP and WP was investigated. The reconstructed series (when the MLRM is calibrated for each month individually) correlate with the original ones up to 0.8 at the interannual time-scale. Besides, when the modeled series for each individual month are merged to construct an October-to-March monthly series, and after removing the annual cycle in order to account for monthly anomalies, these correlate 0.65 (0.55) with the original SP (WP) series in average. These values remain fairly stable when the calibration and reconstruction periods differ, thus supporting up to a point the predictive potential of the method at the time-scale assessed here.},

abstract = {The analysis of the influence of future climatic variations on air quality needs of methods that give a space-time display of large atmospheric data related to air pollution. Here a new approach in order to assess the impacts of climate change on the patterns of variation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) over Europe is presented. The most widely used method of analysis (selected time-slices, future-minus-present method) is very sensitive to the chosen control and future periods because of the internal variability of the climate system. In order to overcome this limitation, full transient simulations for the period 1991-2100 under the SRES A2 scenario are analysed by the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) methodology in order minimise the uncertainty associated to the internal variability due to the longer time series obtained. The results indicate that the EOF1 accounts for around 30-45{\%} of the total variance for the SIA levels and points out a general increase of its trend over the entire domain (p{\textless} 0.005), except in the case of nitrate, whose change signal is not significant (p{\textgreater} 0.1). The correlation between SIA and meteorological parameters indicates that the trends and patterns of variation of aerosols are related to the higher temperature projected for the future climate. It favours the formation of sulphates and ammonium (increasing the concentrations of atmospheric oxidants) and the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the decreases in precipitation have a strong effect on the frequency of the washout and therefore in the levels of aerosols. The concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. The trend from a decreasing mixing height found in several areas of Europe is frequently related to a decrease in precipitation, representing an adding effect for the enhanced future SIA concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Hence, the goal of this study is to determine at what extent concentrations of air pollutants respond to changes over the Iberian Peninsula under a climate change scenario. The methodology includes the use of the regional modeling system MM5 (regional climate model version)-CHIMERE for two nested domains covering Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. Two time slices driven by ECHO-G global circulation model covering from 1991 to 2010 and 2071 to 2100 under the SRES A2 scenario have been compared. Climate change influences the concentrations of both gas-phase pollutants and aerosols through changes in temperature, precipitation, mixing height, transport, humidity, and oxidant levels. The trends of variation of ozone (changes up to 5 ppb, +10{\%} increase during summertime) and aerosols over southwestern Europe are influenced by the higher mean temperature modeled for the future climate (up to +5.4 K), since it favors the formation of secondary gas-phase products. It also enhances sulphates (+2 $\mu$g m-3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) (+2.5 $\mu$g m-3under SRES A2 scenario) and contributes to the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the 17{\%} percent decrease of precipitation modeled for 2071-2100 has a strong effect in the frequency of the washout and therefore in the levels of natural aerosols: the concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Key global energy, environmental and sustainability targets are closely related to the development of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). This includes reduction of Greenhouse Gas emissions and safe energy provision in a sustainable manner. The integration of RES in the energy mix needs to overcome the technical challenges that are related to grid's operation. Therefore, there is an increasing need to explore approaches where different RES will operate under a synergetic approach. A straightforward way to achieve that is by optimizing the complementarity among RES systems both over time and spatially. The present article developed a methodology that examines the degree of time complementarity between small hydropower stations (SHPS) and adjacent solar PV systems (SPVS). The methodology builds on an optimization algorithm that associates hydrological with solar irradiation information. In particularly, the algorithm examines possible alterations on the PV system installation (azimuth, tilt) that increase the complementarity, with minor compromises in the total solar energy output. The methodology has been tested in a case study and the outcome indicated that a compromise of 10{\%} in the solar energy output (90{\%} threshold) may result in a significant increase of the complementarity (66.4{\%}).},

To detect changes in the Earth?s surface radiation field the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and its central archive - the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) - was created in 1992. BSRN is a project of the Radiation Panel (now the Data and Assessment Panel) from the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) under the umbrella of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). It is the global baseline network for surface radiation for the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), contributing to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW), and forming a cooperative network with the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The data are of primary importance in supporting the validation and confirmation of satellite and computer model estimates. At a relatively small number of stations (currently 58) in contrasting climatic zones, solar and atmospheric radiation is measured with instruments of the highest available accuracy and with high temporal resolution (mainly 1 minute). A total of about 7000 station-month datasets were available in the WRMC in mid 2013. All data are interactively accessible to external users for bona fide research purposes at no cost. This report provides information for scientists interested in high quality surface radiation data as well as for scientists running a BSRN station. It offers information about the available data, the data access and describes tools to visualize the data and to check their quality.},

abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation is expanding rapidly in China, with total capacity projected to be 400 GW by 2030. However, severe aerosol pollution over China reduces solar radiation reaching the surface. We estimate the aerosol impact on solar PV electricity generation at the provincial and regional grid levels in China. Our approach is to examine the 12-year (2003–2014) average reduction in point-of-array irradiance (POAI) caused by aerosols in the atmosphere. We apply satellite-derived surface irradiance data from the NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) with a PV performance model (PVLIB-Python) to calculate the impact of aerosols and clouds on POAI. Our findings reveal that aerosols over northern and eastern China, the most polluted regions, reduce annual average POAI by up to 1.5 kWh/m2 per day relative to pollution-free conditions, a decrease of up to 35{\%}. Annual average reductions of POAI over both northern and eastern China are about 20–25{\%}. We also evaluate the seasonal variability of the impact and find that aerosols in this region are as important as clouds in winter. Furthermore, we find that aerosols decrease electricity output of tracking PV systems more than those with fixed arrays: over eastern China, POAI is reduced by 21{\%} for fixed systems at optimal angle and 34{\%} for two-axis tracking systems. We conclude that PV system performance in northern and eastern China will benefit from improvements in air quality and will facilitate that improvement by providing emission-free electricity.},

We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different "P2Y"-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To "functionalize" or to assess the value of the various energy system flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context.

A special observing period (SOP-1a) including intensive airborne measurements was performed in the framework of the Aerosol Direct Radiative Impact on the regional climate in the MEDiterranean region (ADRIMED) project during the Mediterranean dry season over the western and central Mediterranean basins, with a focus on aerosol-radiation measurements and their modeling. The SOP-1a took place from 11 June to 5 July 2013. Airborne measurements were made by both the ATR-42 and F-20 French research aircraft operated from Sardinia (Italy) and instrumented for in situ and remote-sensing measurements, respectively, and by sounding and drifting balloons, launched in Minorca. The experimental setup also involved several ground-based measurement sites on islands including two ground-based reference stations in Corsica and Lampedusa and secondary monitoring sites in Minorca and Sicily. Additional measurements including lidar profiling were also performed on alert during aircraft operations at EARLINET/ACTRIS stations at Granada and Barcelona in Spain, and in southern Italy. Remote-sensing aerosol products from satellites (MSG/SEVIRI, MODIS) and from the AERONET/PHOTONS network were also used. Dedicated meso-scale and regional modeling experiments were performed in relation to this observational effort. We provide here an overview of the different surface and aircraft observations deployed during the ChArMEx/ADRIMED period and of associated modeling studies together with an analysis of the synoptic conditions that determined the aerosol emission and transport. Meteorological conditions observed during this campaign (moderate temperatures and southern flows) were not favorable to producing high levels of atmospheric pollutants or intense biomass burning events in the region. However, numerous mineral dust plumes were observed during the campaign, with the main sources located in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, leading to aerosol optical depth (AOD) values ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 (at 440 nm) over the western and central Mediterranean basins. One important point of this experiment concerns the direct observations of aerosol extinction onboard the ATR-42, using the CAPS system, showing local maxima reaching up to 150 M m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} within the dust plume. Non-negligible aerosol extinction (about 50 M m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) has also been observed within the marine boundary layer (MBL). By combining the ATR-42 extinction coefficient observations with absorption and scattering measurements, we performed a complete optical closure revealing excellent agreement with estimated optical properties. This additional information on extinction properties has allowed calculation of the dust single scattering albedo (SSA) with a high level of confidence over the western Mediterranean. Our results show a moderate variability from 0.90 to 1.00 (at 530 nm) for all flights studied compared to that reported in the literature on this optical parameter. Our results underline also a relatively low difference in SSA with values derived near dust sources. In parallel, active remote-sensing observations from the surface and onboard the F-20 aircraft suggest a complex vertical structure of particles and distinct aerosol layers with sea spray and pollution located within the MBL, and mineral dust and/or aged North American smoke particles located above (up to 6–7 km in altitude). Aircraft and balloon-borne observations allow one to investigate the vertical structure of the aerosol size distribution showing particles characterized by a large size ({\&}gt; 10 µm in diameter) within dust plumes. In most of cases, a coarse mode characterized by an effective diameter ranging between 5 and 10 µm, has been detected above the MBL. In terms of shortwave (SW) direct forcing, in situ surface and aircraft observations have been merged and used as inputs in 1-D radiative transfer codes for calculating the aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF). Results show significant surface SW instantaneous forcing (up to −90 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at noon). Aircraft observations provide also original estimates of the vertical structure of SW and LW radiative heating revealing significant instantaneous values of about 5° K per day in the solar spectrum (for a solar angle of 30°) within the dust layer. Associated 3-D modeling studies from regional climate (RCM) and chemistry transport (CTM) models indicate a relatively good agreement for simulated AOD compared with observations from the AERONET/PHOTONS network and satellite data, especially for long-range dust transport. Calculations of the 3-D SW (clear-sky) surface DRF indicate an average of about −10 to −20 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (for the whole period) over the Mediterranean Sea together with maxima (−50 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) over northern Africa. The top of the atmosphere (TOA) DRF is shown to be highly variable within the domain, due to moderate absorbing properties of dust and changes in the surface albedo. Indeed, 3-D simulations indicate negative forcing over the Mediterranean Sea and Europe and positive forcing over northern Africa. Finally, a multi-year simulation, performed for the 2003 to 2009 period and including an ocean–atmosphere (O–A) coupling, underlines the impact of the aerosol direct radiative forcing on the sea surface temperature, O–A fluxes and the hydrological cycle over the Mediterranean.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The forecast model is applied to GHI data gathered from two distinct locations (Davis and Merced) that represent well the geographical distribution of solar irradiance in the San Joaquin Valley. The forecasting approach uses information gathered from satellite image analysis including velocimetry and cloud indexing as inputs to the ANN models. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first attempt to hybridize stochastic learning and image processing approaches for solar irradiance forecasting. We compare the hybrid approaches using standard error metrics to quantify the forecasting skill for the several time horizons considered.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) modules in real operation present angular losses in reference to their behaviour in standard test conditions, due to the angle of incidence of the incident radiation and the surface soil. Although these losses are not always negligible, they are commonly not taken into account when correcting the electrical characteristics of the PV module or estimating the energy production of PV systems. The main reason of this approximation is the lack of easy-to-use mathematical expressions for the angular losses calculation. This paper analyses these losses on PV modules and presents an analytical model based on theoretical and experimental results. The proposed model fits monocrystalline as well as polycrystalline and amorphous silicon PV modules, and contemplates the existence of superficial dust. With it angular losses integrated over time periods of interest can be easily calculated. Monthly and annual losses have been calculated for 10 different European sites, having diverse climates and latitudes (ranging from 32?? to 52??), and considering different module tilt angles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming useful as alternate approaches to conventional techniques or as components of integrated systems. They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas and are becoming more popular nowadays. They can learn from examples, are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data, are able to deal with nonlinear problems and once trained can perform prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being developed and deployed worldwide in a wide variety of applications, mainly because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation capabilities. AI has been used in different sectors, such as engineering, economics, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting and control of complex systems. The paper outlines an understanding of how AI systems operate by way of presenting a number of problems in photovoltaic systems application. Problems presented include three areas: forecasting and modeling of meteorological data, sizing of photovoltaic systems and modeling, simulation and control of photovoltaic systems.

abstract = {Wind and solar energy are expected to play a major role in the current decade to help Europe reaching the renewable energy penetration targets fixed by Directive 2009/28/EC. However, it is difficult to predict the actual production profiles of wind and solar energy as they depend heavily on variable meteorological features of solar radiation and wind speed. In an ideal system, wind and solar electricity are both injected in a fast reacting grid instantaneously matching supply and demand. In such a system wind and solar electricity production profiles should complement each other as much as possible in order to minimise the need of storage and additional capacity. In the present paper the complementarity of wind and solar resources is assessed for a test year in Italy.To achieve this goal we employ data at high spatial and temporal resolution data for both solar radiation and wind speed in Italy obtained from running two state of the art models (PVGIS and MINNI). Hourly profiles for solar and wind energy produced are compared in each 4×4km2 grid cell in Italy for 2005, and hourly, daily and monthly correlation coefficients are computed in order to assess the local complementarity of the two resources. A Monte Carlo approach is also developed to estimate how large-scale wind and solar energy productions could be potentially involved to complement each other in a scenario with up to 100 production sites across Italy. The results show how local complementarity can be very interesting with monthly correlation coefficients reaching values lower than-0.8 in several areas. Large-scale complementarity is also relevant with nation-wide monthly correlation coefficients showing values between-0.65 and-0.6. These model results indicate that in this sample year of 2005, wind and solar energy potential production have shown complementary time behaviour complementary, favourably supporting their integration in the energy system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In parallel, AOD climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of this unique multiyear database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, seasalt, sulfate, black and organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products: NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS, ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth-Probe) and METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4, the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS and MACC. Ground-based Level- 2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this region, showing a relevant spatiotemporal variability and highlighting high dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations, which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology.We extend the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosolclimate studies.},

abstract = {To support climate research, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) initiated a new radiometric network, the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). The network aims at providing validation material for satellite radi- ometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term variations in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play an important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN, consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S, and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to scientific communities in vari- ous ways depending on the communication environment of the users. The present article discusses the scientific base, organizational and technical aspects of the network, and data retrieval methods; shows various application possibilities; and presents the future tasks to be accomplished.},

abstract = {The energy produced by a photovoltaic system over a given period can be estimated from the incident radiation at the site where the Grid Connected PV System (GCPVS) is located, assuming knowledge of certain basic features of the system under study. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of solar radiation, the question "How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this location over the next few years?" involves an exercise of prediction inevitably subjected to a degree of uncertainty. Moreover, during the life cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: "Is the system working correctly?". This paper proposes and examines several methods to cope with these questions. The daily performance of a PV system is simulated. This simulation and the interannual variability of both radiation and productivity are statistically analyzed. From the results several regression adjustments are obtained. This analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity prediction and performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical analysis of the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method of malfunctioning parts of the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the correlation between the fluctuations of the electrical power generated by the ensemble of 70. DC/AC inverters from a 45.6. MW PV plant. The use of real electrical power time series from a large collection of photovoltaic inverters of a same plant is an important contribution in the context of models built upon simplified assumptions to overcome the absence of such data. This data set is divided into three different fluctuation categories with a clustering procedure which performs correctly with the clearness index and the wavelet variances. Afterwards, the time dependent correlation between the electrical power time series of the inverters is estimated with the wavelet transform. The wavelet correlation depends on the distance between the inverters, the wavelet time scales and the daily fluctuation level. Correlation values for time scales below one minute are low without dependence on the daily fluctuation level. For time scales above 20. min, positive high correlation values are obtained, and the decay rate with the distance depends on the daily fluctuation level. At intermediate time scales the correlation depends strongly on the daily fluctuation level. The proposed methods have been implemented using free software.

Vietnam has a dense and long network of sunshine duration measurements, and on the contrary the country has a scarce availability of solar irradiance measuring sites. The variability of long term solar radiation can be analyzed by determining daily global irradiation from sunshine duration. A model inspired in Angstrom equation has been developed using the canonical correlation analysis with good performance. The output of the model has been used for characterizing the dispersion of long term solar radiation and its spatial distribution has been also studied by clustering techniques.

abstract = {Feasibility analysis for CSP projects requires quantifying the economic risk associated with the inter-annual variability of the solar resource and uncertainties in the annual energy production estimates. To assess this risk, statistical methods may be applied either before the system simulation (e.g. to create solar resource data in terms of exceedance probabilities such a P50 or P90) or on the system performance to determine the likelihood that a power plant will generate a certain amount of energy in any given year over the plant's life (e.g. the P50 or P90 annual productions). This paper presents and illustrates the long-term analysis of four CSP plants (parabolic trough and central receiver technology) in four sites within the Mediterranean and North Africa region; the analysis includes the exceedance probabilities estimations. Satellite-derived data for 20 years have been used for solar resource datasets in hourly basis, and multiyear simulations of the plant output have been performed with System Advisor Model. The associated uncertainties have been included in the long-term analysis of both DNI and CSP plant production. The results remark the advantages of multiyear analysis of CSP output for long-term analysis against the use of artificial meteorological years which represent the long-term.},

The CDRs are available free of charge for all purposes from wui.cmsaf.eu at monthly, daily and hourly means at a spatial resolution of 0.03.The processing employed a climate version of the Heliosat algorithm combined with a clear sky model using an eigenvector look-up table method. Modifications to the Heliosat method include a self-calibration algorithm as well as a running mean based clear sky retrieval algorithm.The datasets are validated using ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) as a reference. The validation threshold for the mean absolute bias between satellite-derived and surface-measured radiation is given by the target accuracy for solar irradiance fields defined by the Global Climate Observing system (GCOS) and a measurement uncertainty for the surface data. The results demonstrate that the target accuracy is achieved for monthly and daily means. Furthermore, an intercomparison with similar datasets reveal a better performance and climate monitoring potential of the CM SAF SIS CDR at most BSRN sites compared to established data sets like e.g. ERA-reanalysis, GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project). Lastly, the realistic representation of both seasonal and inter-annual variability guarantees the applicability of the satellite-based climate data sets for climate monitoring and analysis of extremes.No trends in the normalized bias between the CM SAF and the BSRN datasets are detectable, which demonstrates the stability and homogeneity of the global and direct irradiance for the period covered by BSRN measurements. However, inconsistencies are detectable at few satellite transition dates for certain regions in earlier years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The importance for reliable forecasts of incoming solar radiation is growing rapidly, especially for those countries with an increasing share in photovoltaic (PV) power production. The reliability of solar radiation forecasts depends mainly on the representation of clouds and aerosol particles absorbing and scattering radiation. Especially under extreme aerosol conditions, numerical weather prediction has a systematic bias in the solar radiation forecast. This is caused by the design of numerical weather prediction models, which typically account for the direct impact of aerosol particles on radiation using climatological mean values and the impact on cloud formation assuming spatially and temporally homogeneous aerosol concentrations. These model deficiencies in turn can lead to significant economic losses under extreme aerosol conditions. For Germany, Saharan dust outbreaks occurring 5 to 15 times per year for several days each are prominent examples for conditions, under which numerical weather prediction struggles to forecast solar radiation adequately. We investigate the impact of mineral dust on the PV power generation during a Saharan dust outbreak over Germany at 4 April 2014 using ICON-ART, which is the current German numerical weather prediction model extended by modules accounting for trace substances and related feedback processes. We find an overall improvement of the PV power forecast for 65{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the pyranometer stations in Germany. Of the nine stations with very high differences between forecast and measurement, eight stations show an improvement. Furthermore, we quantify the direct radiative effects and indirect radiative effects of mineral dust. For our study, direct effects account for 64{\&}thinsp;{\%}, indirect effects for 20{\&}thinsp;{\%} and synergistic interaction effects for 16{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the differences between the forecast including mineral dust radiative effects and the forecast neglecting mineral dust.},

abstract = { AbstractThe Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and vulnerable climate change “hotspots” of the twenty-first century, and the physical mechanisms underlying this finding are still not clear. Furthermore, complex interactions and feedbacks involving ocean–atmosphere–land–biogeochemical processes play a prominent role in modulating the climate and environment of the Mediterranean region on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is critical to provide robust climate change information for use in vulnerability–impact–adaptation assessment studies considering the Mediterranean as a fully coupled environmental system. The Mediterranean Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Med-CORDEX) initiative aims at coordinating the Mediterranean climate modeling community toward the development of fully coupled regional climate simulations, improving all relevant components of the system from atmosphere and ocean dynamics to land surface, hydrology, and biogeochemical processes. The primary goals of Med-CORDEX are to improve understanding of past climate variability and trends and to provide more accurate and reliable future projections, assessing in a quantitative and robust way the added value of using high-resolution and coupled regional climate models. The coordination activities and the scientific outcomes of Med-CORDEX can produce an important framework to foster the development of regional Earth system models in several key regions worldwide. },

abstract = "Abstract There is a growing interest in the study of decadal variations in surface solar radiation during the last decades, although the analyses of long-term time series in some areas with major gaps in observations, such as in Spain, are still pending. This work describes for the first time the development of a new dataset of surface solar radiation in Spain based on the longest series with records of global solar radiation (G), most of them starting in the early 1980s. Additional records of diffuse solar radiation (D), which is a component of G much less studied due to the general scarcity of long-term series, are available for some of these series. Particular emphasis is placed upon the homogenization of this dataset in order to ensure the reliability of the trends, which can be affected by non-natural factors such as relocations or changes of instruments. The mean annual G series over Spain shows a tendency to increase during the 1985–2010 period, with a significant linear trend of + 3.9 W m− 2 per decade. Similar significant increases are observed in the mean seasonal series, with the highest rate of change during summer (+ 6.5 W m− 2 per decade) and secondly in autumn (+ 4.1 W m− 2 per decade) and spring (+ 3.2 W m− 2 per decade). These results are in line with the widespread increase of G, also known as brightening period, reported at many worldwide observation sites. Furthermore, the annual mean D series starts without relevant variations during the second half of the 1980s, but it is disturbed by a strong increase in 1991 and 1992, which might reflect the signal of the Pinatubo volcanic eruption. Afterwards, the mean series shows a tendency to decrease up to the mid-2000s, with a significant linear trend of − 2.1 W m− 2 per decade during the 1985–2010 period. All these results point towards a diminution of clouds and/or aerosols over the area. "

In this paper, we investigate techniques to determine the number of clusters or segments to return from hierarchical clustering and segmentation algorithms. We propose an efficient algorithm, the L method, that finds the knee in a of clusters vs. clustering evaluation metric graph. Using the knee is well-known, but is not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine in which situations it will and will not work. We also compare the L method to existing methods based on the accuracy of the number of clusters that are determined and efficiency.

abstract = {The operation of hydroelectric plants in Brazil depends on the hydrological regime, which is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations and faces critical levels of storage in certain periods. Hydropower accounts for 66{\%} of the countrys generation and poses a challenge for the stabilization of the grid in the mid and long terms. Usually, such fluctuations are complemented by conventional sources (thermo power). Studies have shown, however, that wind power can assist hydroelectric power generation. The water saved can be stored for energy generation and other purposes. This work addresses the possibility of complementing the hydro system with offshore wind power. To do so, monthly precipitation data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU-TS 3.1) [1] is compared with satellite winds from NOAA [2,3], to assess their variability on seasonal and interannual time scales. Results show high wind magnitudes in the North, Northeast, Southeast and Southern regions of Brazil. There is strong seasonal complementarity between the wind regimes of the Northeast and Northern regions. North and especially Northeast offshore winds were shown to be highly complementary with the hydrological regimes of S{\~{a}}o Francisco, Eastern Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, Paran{\'{a}}, Paraguai, Uruguai and South Atlantic basins. In addition, the southern hydrographic basin variability was found uncorrelated with other hydrological basins and wind regions.},

abstract = {The solar radiation model r.sun is a flexible and efficient tool for the estimation of solar radiation for clear-sky and overcast atmospheric conditions. In contrast to other models, r.sun considers all relevant input parameters as spatially distributed entities to enable computations for large areas with complex terrain. Conceptually the model is based on equations published in the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA). The r.sun model was applied to estimate the solar potential for photovoltaic systems in Central and Eastern Europe. The overcast radiation was computed from clear-sky values and a clear-sky index. The raster map of the clear-sky index was computed using a multivariate interpolation method to account for terrain effects, with inter- polation parameters optimized using a cross-validation technique. The incorporation of terrain data improved the radiation estimates in terms of the model's predictive error and the spatial pattern of the model outputs. Comparing the results of r.sun with the ESRA database demonstrates that integration of the solar radiation model and the spatial interpolation tools in a GIS can be especially helpful for data at higher resolutions and in regions with a lack of ground measurements.},

abstract = {Climate change may alter the geographical pattern and intensity of near-surface winds which are the "fuel" for wind turbines. In a context of fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within ±15 and ±20 {\%} by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will not exceed 5 and 15 {\%} in magnitude at the European and national scale respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy mix plans.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

First, the problematic of using meteorological ground stations for the determining of solar dataset or time-series is addressed with the example of the French national meteorological network and the focus made on the South-West part of France: the heterogeneity in terms of spatial and temporal representativeness along with the relevance of the delivered measurement are questioned. Then, an innovative synthesis of 16 satellite-based ISS databases available so far is presented through the distribution of their corresponding features within three categories: spatial and temporal representativeness, data type in terms of component and format, and finally operating mode for the retrieving of the data in terms of price and accessibility. The results of this review shall help photovoltaic actors making the correlation between the available satellite-based databases and their specific needs.},

@article{Widen2015,
abstract = {Integrating variable and non-dispatchable renewable power generation into existing power systems will have consequences for their operation and future expansion. These impacts will depend on two factors: (1) the variability of the total renewable power generation on different time scales and (2) the possibilities of accurately forecasting these fluctuations. In this paper, previous research on variability assessment and forecasting of solar, wind, wave and tidal energy resources is reviewed. The aim is to summarize the state of knowledge in each area and to compare the approaches used for the respective resources. For temporal variability, methods and models used for assessing the variability are surveyed, as well as what is known about the variability at individual sites and for larger aggregates of sites. For forecasting, an overview of forecasting methods for the different resources is made, and selected forecasting methods are compared over different time horizons. An important finding is that it is hard to draw strong conclusions from the existing studies due to differences in approaches and presentation of results. There is a need for further, more coherent studies that analyze the variability for the different resources in comparable ways, using data with the same resolution, and for studies that evaluate the smoothing effect and complementarity of combinations of several renewable energy resources. For forecasting, future research should suggest ways to evaluate forecasts from different renewable energy sources in easily comparable ways, using data from the same locations or regions, with the same temporal and spatial resolution, and with comparable metrics for the forecasting errors.},

abstract = {Variations in solar radiation incident at Earth's surface profoundly affect the human and terrestrial environment. A decline in solar radiation at land surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from 1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.},

Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness of the proposed sites is also assessed. The proposed number of stations could be considered as the basis to build the climatology of surface solar irradiance over Greece. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This work presents a cluster analysis for the determination of coherent zones of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) for a utility scale territory in California, which is serviced by San Diego Gas {\&} Electric. Knowledge of these coherent zones, or clusters, would allow utilities and power plants to realize cost savings through regional planning and operation activities such as the mitigation of solar power variability through the intelligent placement of solar farms and the optimal placement of radiometric stations. In order to determine such clusters, two years of gridded satellite data were used to describe the evolution of GHI over a portion of Southern California. Step changes of the average daily clear-sky index at each location are used to characterize the fluctuation of GHI. The k-means clustering algorithm is applied in conjunction with a stable initialization method to diminish its dependency to random initial conditions. Two validity indices are then used to define the quality of the cluster partitions as well as the appropriate number of clusters. The clustering algorithm determined an optimal number of 14 coherent spatial clusters of similar GHI variability as the most appropriate segmentation of the service territory map. In addition, 14 cluster centers are selected whose radiometric observations may serve as a proxy for the rest of the cluster. A correlation analysis, within and between the proposed clusters, based both on single-point ground-based and satellite-derived measurements evaluates positively the coherence of the conducted clustering. This method could easily be applied to any other utility scale region and is not dependent on GHI data which shows promise for the application of such clustering methods to load data and/or other renewable resources such as wind. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose a novel methodology to select candidate locations for solar power plants that take into account solar variability and geographical smoothing effects. This methodology includes the development of maps created by a clustering technique that determines regions of coherent solar quality attributes as defined by a feature which considers both solar clearness and solar variability. An efficient combination of two well-known clustering algorithms, the affinity propagation and the k-means, is introduced in order to produce stable partitions of the data to a variety of number of clusters in a computationally fast and reliable manner. We use 15. years worth of the 30-min GHI gridded data for the island of Lanai in Hawaii to produce, validate and reproduce clustering maps. A family of appropriate number of clusters is obtained by evaluating the performance of three internal validity indices. We apply a correlation analysis to the family of solutions to determine the map segmentation that maximizes a definite interpretation of the distinction between and within the emerged clusters. Having selected a single clustering we validated the clustering by using a new dataset to demonstrate that the degree of similarity between the two partitions remains high at 90.91{\%}. In the end we show how the clustering map can be used in solar energy problems. Firstly, we explore the effects of geographical smoothing in terms of the clustering maps, by determining the average ramp ratio for two location within and without the same cluster and identify the pair of clusters that shows the highest smoothing potential. Secondly, we demonstrate how the map can be used to select locations for GHI measurements to improve solar forecasting for a PV plant, by showing that additional measurements from within the cluster where the PV plant is located can lead to improvements of 10{\%} in the forecast.},

abstract = {This pair of articles presents the results of a study about forecasting photovoltaic (PV) electricity production for some power plants in mainland France. Forecasts are built with statistical methods exploiting outputs from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Contrary to most other studies, forecasts are built without using technical information on the power plants. In each article, several statistical methods are used to build forecast models and their performance is compared by means of adequate scores. When a best forecast emerges, its characteristics are then further assessed in order to get a deeper insight of its merits and flaws. The robustness of the results are evaluated with an intense use of cross-validation.This article deals with probabilistic forecasts of daily production 2. days ahead. By "probabilistic" we mean that our forecast models yield some quantiles of the expected production's probability distribution. Whereas probabilistic forecasts are quite usual in wind power forecasting, they are more unusual in the field of PV production forecasting. We show that our eight forecasts always perform better than a simple climatological reference forecast. Nevertheless, no forecast model clearly dominates the other, whatever the studied power plant. A post-processing technique aiming at improving forecasts may in fact decrease their performance. Finally, we use outputs from an ensemble NWP model in order to add information about the meteorological forecast uncertainty. Sometimes this ensemble improves the performance of forecasts, but this is not always true. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
