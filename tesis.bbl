  The statistics of hourly global radiation are analysed for various climates
  and locations, at time scales ranging from one month to one hour. The
  probabilistic and sequential properties of the hourly clearness index ktare
  related with a variety of parameters, including the daily clearness index
  Ktand the solar altitude angle h, thereby displaying the nonstationary and
  time-inhomogeneous nature of hourly radiation. Analytical expressions for the
  probability distribution of ktare proposed (truncated Gaussian functions
  depending on Ktand h). The results reported in this paper provide a deeper
  understanding of hourly solar radiation statistics, and explain some of the
  features displayed by radiation data at longer time scales. From the
  practical point of view they have implications, for example, for the
  construction of models for generating synthetic radiation data, an important
  and often indispensable tool for designing and simulating solar systems.

  This paper evaluates the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF)
  sensitivity to eight different combinations of cumulus, microphysics, and
  planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes over a
  topographically complex region in southern Spain (Andalusia) for the period
  1990–99. The WRF configuration consisted of a 10-km-resolution domain
  nested in a coarser domain driven by 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range
  Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data, with spectral nudging above the
  PBL employed over the latter domain. The model outputs have been compared at
  different time scales with an observational dataset that comprises 438 rain
  gauges and 152 temperature stations with records of both daily maximum and
  minimum temperatures. To reduce the ‘‘representation error,'' the
  validation with observations has been performed using a multistep
  regionalization that distinguishes five precipitation regions and four
  temperature regions. The analysis proves that both cumulus and PBL schemes
  have a crucial impact on the description of precipitation in Andalusia,
  whereas no noticeable differences between microphysics options were
  appreciated. Temperature is described similarly by all the configurations,
  except for the PBL choice affecting minimum values. WRF provides a definite
  improvement over ERA-40 in the climate description in terms of frequency,
  spatial distribution, and intensity of extreme events. It also captures more
  accurately the annual cycle and reduces the biases and the RMSE for monthly
  precipitation, whereas only a minor enh2ancement of these features was
  obtained for monthly-mean maximum and minimum temperatures. The results
  indicate that WRF is able to correctly reproduce Andalusian climate and
  produces useful added-value information for climate studies.%

  We present an atmosphere–ocean regional climate model for the Mediterranean
  basin, called the PROTHEUS system, composed by the regional climate model
  RegCM3 as the atmospheric component and by a regional configuration of the
  MITgcm model as the oceanic component. The model is applied to an area
  encompassing the Mediterranean Sea and compared to a stand-alone version of
  its atmospheric component. An assessment of the model performances is done by
  using available observational datasets. Despite a persistent bias, the
  PROTHEUS system is able to capture the inter-annual variability of seasonal
  sea surface temperature (SST) and also the fine scale spatio-temporal
  evolution of observed SST anomalies, with spatial correlation as high as 0.7
  during summer. The close inspection of a 10-day strong wind event during the
  summer of 2000 proves the capability of the PROTHEUS system to correctly
  describe the daily evolution of SST under strong air–sea interaction
  conditions. As a consequence of the model's skill in reproducing observed SST
  and wind fields, we expect a reliable estimation of air–sea fluxes. The
  model skill in reproducing climatological land surface fields is in line with
  that of state of the art regional climate models.%

  The objective of the present work is to compare the projections of surface
  solar radiation (SSR) simulated by four regional climate models (CCLM, RCA4,
  WRF, ALADIN) with the respective fields of their ten driving CMIP5 global
  climate models. First the annual and seasonal SSR changes are examined in the
  regional and in the global climate models based on the RCP8.5 emission
  scenarios. The results show significant discrepancies between the projected
  SSR, the multi-model mean of RCMs indicates a decrease in SSR of −0.60 W/m2
  per decade over Europe, while the multi-model mean of the associated GCMs
  used to drive the RCMs gives an increase in SSR of +0.39 W/m2 per decade for
  the period of 2006--2100 over Europe. At seasonal scale the largest
  differences appear in spring and summer. The different signs of SSR projected
  changes can be interpreted as the consequence of the different behavior of
  cloud cover in global and regional climate models. Cloudiness shows a
  significant decline in GCMs with −0.24{\%} per decade which explains the
  extra income in SSR, while in case of the regional models no significant
  changes in cloudiness can be detected. The reduction of SSR in RCMs can be
  attributed to increasing atmospheric absorption in line with the increase of
  water vapor content. Both global and regional models overestimate SSR in
  absolute terms as compared to surface observations, in line with an
  underestimation of cloud cover. Regional models further have difficulties to
  adequately reproduce the observed trends in SSR over the past decades.%

  The aim of this study is to estimate projected changes of global radiation
  parallel to the global warming in south-eastern Europe. As a first step,
  statistical dependence of global radiation from local cloud indicators is
  analysed for a short period (1992–1996). Global radiation is derived from
  METEOSAT visual images, whereas cloud coverage is described in two parallel
  ways: surface-based visual cloudiness from 171 stations of the region and
  satellite based Outgoing Long-wave Radiation (OLR). In the second step
  regression coefficients of these cloud indicators against the hemispherical
  mean temperature are determined using an adaptation of the method of
  instrumental variables in recent monotonously warming periods: i.e.
  1973–1996 for cloudiness, and 1979–2000 for the OLR. The local variables
  are used as independent variables of the first step and as dependent
  variables of the second one. As the last step of the whole computation the
  regression coefficients derived in the first and second step are combined to
  calculate expected change of global radiation. The product of the two
  regression coefficients typically yields a few percent of relative changes in
  global radiation considering 0.5K hemispherical warming. The signs of the
  changes are overwhelmingly positive, indicating more solar energy expected to
  be available for agricultural and industrial purposes.%

  Solar energy use in the UK is increasing dramatically, providing both heat
  energy and generation of electricity. This trend is expected to continue due
  to solar technologies becoming cheaper and more readily available along with
  low carbon government legislation such as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI)
  and Feed in Tariffs (FiTs) supporting solar energy deployment. However, the
  effects of climate change on the solar resource remain largely unstudied.
  Climate change affects cloud cover characteristics and consequently directly
  affects the performance of solar energy technologies. This paper investigates
  the UK solar irradiation resource for both the present and future climates.
  The present solar irradiation level was assessed through the conversion of 30
  years of observed historical monthly average sunshine duration data. The
  method and results are validated by comparing the converted solar irradiation
  levels to actual solar irradiance measurements at weather stations with
  significant historical records of solar irradiance data. The impact of
  climate change is investigated across different regions of the UK by using
  the UKCP09 probabilistic climate change projections. We find that the current
  average UK annual solar resource is 101.2Wm-2, ranging from 128.4 Wm-2 in the
  south of England to 71.8Wm-2 in the northwest of Scotland. It seems likely
  that climate change will increase the average resource in the south of the
  UK, while marginally decreasing it in the Northwest. The overall effect is a
  mean increase of the UK solar resource, however it will have greater seasonal
  variability and discrepancies between geographical regions will be
  reinforced. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.%

  In this paper, we report two human factors studies performed to investigate
  human performance in tasks involving dextrous manipulations of virtual
  objects with haptic feedback. These studies were performed at the Man-Machine
  Interface Laboratory (Rutgers University, NJ, USA) and at the Laboratoire de
  Robotique de Paris (CRIIF-LRP). Different haptic devices were used : the
  Rutgers Master, the LRP Force Feedback Glove (LRP), and the ITR device
  (Interface Technology Research, UK). These experiments involved (1) accurate
  placements of virtual objects and (2) grasping-force regulation. In the
  former case, we compared the LRP FFG (that provides complex haptic cueing)
  and the ITR device(that provides binary haptic cueing : grasped/not grasped).
  In the latter case, we investigated the effect of sensory substitution
  (synesthetic representation of haptic informations) to convey virtual haptic
  cues using the visual and auditory sensory channels. Results of the
  experiments showed that (1) information redundancy (display of visual or
  auditory force feedback in addition to finger force feedback) allowed to
  increase performance compared to finger force feedback alone, and (2) simple
  tactual feedback (provided by the ITR device) allowed similar performance
  than complex force feedback (provided by the LRP FFG). This result led us to
  think that complex force feedback cues are not required in simple
  manipulation task (i.e. when grasping regulation forces is not crucial). In
  this case binary haptic information could be sufficient%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A review of more than 60 studies (plus m4ore than 65 studies on P2G) on power
  and energy models based on simulation and optimization was done. Based on
  these, for power systems with up to 95{\%} renewables, the electricity
  storage size is found to be below 1.5{\%} of the annual demand (in energy
  terms). While for 100{\%} renewables energy systems (power, heat, mobility),
  it can remain below 6{\%} of the annual energy demand. Combination of sectors
  and diverting the electricity to another sector can play a large role in
  reducing the storage size. From the potential alternatives to satisfy this
  demand, pumped hydro storage (PHS) global potential is not enough and new
  technologies with a higher energy density are needed. Hydrogen, with more
  than 250 times the energy density of PHS is a potential option to satisfy the
  storage need. However, changes needed in infrastructure to deal with high
  hydrogen content and the suitability of salt caverns for its storage can pose
  limitations for this technology. Power to Gas (P2G) arises as possible
  alternative overcoming both the facilities and the energy density issues. The
  global storage requirement would represent only 2{\%} of the global annual
  natural gas production or 10{\%} of the gas storage facilities (in energy
  equivalent). The more options considered to deal with intermittent sources,
  the lower the storage requirement will be. Therefore, future studies aiming
  to quantify storage needs should focus on the entire energy system including
  technology vectors (e.g. Power to Heat, Liquid, Gas, Chemicals) to avoid
  overestimating the amount of storage needed.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The combination of hydroelectric and photovoltaic sources of energy in a
  generation system may seem unfeasible due to the still quite high costs of
  the photovoltaic plants. However in the next few decades, significant
  reductions in those costs are to be expected. Moreover, this combination may
  reduce the cost of plants implemented in low hydroelectric potential sites
  for which main system interconnection costs prove prohibitive. The study of
  hybrid hydro-PV generating plants allows the evaluation of the use of water
  reservoirs and battery banks as alternatives for energy storage within a
  system. It also allows the evaluation of the advantages of generation from
  complementary energy sources. The objectives of this paper is to propose the
  concept of a theoretical performance limit for the plants and propose a
  method for the determination of this performance limit using computer
  simulations with idealized energy availability functions. Using this method,
  the effect of different degrees of complementarity in time of the energy
  resources on the performance of hydro PV plants is studied. It has been
  observed that, as expected, the smallest failure indexes measuring the energy
  supply to the consumers are associated to the best complementarity in time
  indexes. The results of the simulations led to the synthesis of failure index
  curves, as functions of the different degrees of complementarity in time,
  with data obtained solely with the utilization of idealized functions
  describing the energy availabilities, as proposed in this work. The results
  so obtained are a preliminary set treating the influence of the
  complementarity characteristics on the performance of hybrid plants based on
  hydro and solar energies and show how the complementarity characteristics may
  be used to design hybrid power generation systems showing improved
  efficiency. The subsequent research work shall proceed to at least two
  different phases. In the first one, the method exposed in the present work
  shall be applied to real data and compared to the operation of existing hydro
  PV plants. In the second phase the obtained relations of the performance of
  the system to the different degrees of complementarity shall be confronted
  with design parameters of hydroelectric-photovoltaic plants based on
  complementary resources. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.%

  Due to the rapidly growing photovoltaic (PV) market in Germany, solar
  electricity fed in the grid amounts already to a share of approx. 2{\%} of
  the total grid load during midday summertime. This is already a significant
  figure for grid operators. For several years a wind power prediction for wind
  energy is already available. But until now, there has been no operational
  solar electricity forecast. Therefore, the paper is aimed at providing an
  approach for a solar electricity forecast system based on the forecasts of
  the European center of midrange weather forecast ECMWF locally refined by
  model output statistics MOS with local weather stations. To evaluate the
  results, they have been compared with measured values of several thousand PV
  plants in Germany. The results show for daily values an RMSE of 24.5 {\%} for
  the months July and August 2006, which is of course a satisfying result.

  The interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological
  conditions are often ignored in favor of single-year data sets for modeling
  power generation and evaluating the economic value of photovoltaic (PV) power
  systems. Yet interannual variability significantly impacts the generation
  from one year to another of renewable power systems such as wind and PV.
  Consequently, the interannual variability of power generation corresponds to
  the interannual variability of capital returns on investment. The penetration
  of PV systems within the Hawaiian Electric Companies' portfolio has rapidly
  accelerated in recent years and is expected to continue to increase given the
  state's energy objectives laid out by the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. We
  use the National Solar Radiation Database (1998–2015) to characterize the
  interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological conditions
  across the State of Hawaii. These data sets are passed to the National
  Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisory Model (SAM) to calculate an
  18-year PV power generation data set to characterize the variability of PV
  power generation. We calculate the interannual coefficient of variability
  (COV) for annual average global horizontal irradiance (GHI) on the order of
  2{\%} and COV for annual capacity factor on the order of 3{\%} across the
  Hawaiian archipelago. Regarding the interannual variability of seasonal
  trends, we calculate the COV for monthly average GHI values on the order of
  5{\%} and COV for monthly capacity factor on the order of 10{\%}. We model
  residential-scale and utility-scale PV systems and calculate the economic
  returns of each system via the payback period and the net present value. We
  demonstrate that studies based on single-year data sets for economic
  evaluations reach conclusions that deviate from the true values realized by
  accounting for interannual variability.%

  We use reanalysis data to investigate the daily co-variability of wind and
  solar irradiance in Britain, and its implications for renewable energy supply
  balancing. The joint distribution of daily-mean wind speeds and irradiances
  shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to
  the rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with
  wind speed throughout the year (−0.4≲$\rho$≲−0.2): there is a weak
  tendency for windy days to be cloudier. This is particularly true in
  Atlantic-facing regions (western Scotland, south-west England). The east
  coast of Britain has the weakest anticorrelation, particularly in winter,
  primarily associated with a relative increase in the frequency of
  clear-but-windy days. We also consider the variability in total power output
  from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In all months,
  daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar
  capacity. The scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately
  70{\%}-solar to 30{\%}-wind. This work emphasises the importance of
  considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on
  long-term average relationships or correlations. In particular, the
  anticorrelation between wind and solar power in Britain cannot solely be
  relied upon to produce a well-balanced energy supply.%

  Exploiting the added value of the ensemble of high-resolution model
  simulations provided by the Med-CORDEX coordinated initiative, an updated
  assessment of Mediterranean extreme precipitation events as represented in
  different observational, reanalysis and modelling datasets is presented. A
  spatiotemporal characterisation of the long-term statistics of extreme
  precipitation is performed, using a number of different diagnostic indices.
  Employing a novel approach based on the timing of extreme precipitation
  events a number of physically consistent subregions are defined. The
  comparison of different diagnostics over the Mediterranean domain and
  physically homogeneous sub-domains is presented and discussed, focussing on
  the relative impact of several model configuration features (resolution,
  coupling, physical parameterisations) on the performance in reproducing
  extreme precipitation events. It is found that the agreement between the
  observed and modelled long-term statistics of extreme precipitation is more
  sensitive to the model physics, in particular convective parameterisation,
  than to other model configurations such as resolution and coupling.%

  A method for identifying clusters of points in a multi - dimensional
  Euclidean space is described and its application to taxonomy considered. It
  reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the
  spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the
  divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek et al. (l951a), is
  constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by
  applying the criterion of minimum within-cluster sum of squares. This
  procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits.
  The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly
  suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal
  indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a "variance
  ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The
  method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The
  results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by
  using the agglomerative method of Ward (1963) and the divisive method of
  Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).%

  We assess the impact of two sources of uncertainties in a limited area model
  (LAM) on the representation of intense precipitation: the size of the domain
  of integration and the use of the spectral nudging technique (driving of the
  large-scale within the domain of integration). We work in a perfect-model
  approach where the LAM is driven by a general circulation model (GCM) run at
  the same resolution and sharing the same physics and dynamics as the LAM. A
  set of three 50 km resolution simulations run over Western Europe with the
  LAM ALADIN-Climate and the GCM ARPEGE-Climate are performed to address this
  issue. Results are consistent with previous studies regarding the
  seasonal-mean fields. Furthermore, they show that neither the use of the
  spectral nudging nor the choice of a small domain are detrimental to the
  modelling of heavy precipitation in the present experiment.%

  In the paper two models implemented to forecast the hourly solar irradiance
  with a day in advance are described. The models, based on Artificial Neural
  Networks (ANN), are generated by a master optimization process that defines
  the best number of neurons and selects a suitable ensemble of ANN. The two
  models consist of a Statistical (ST) model that uses only local measured data
  and a Model Output Statistics (MOS) that corrects Numerical Weather
  Prediction (NWP) data. ST and MOS are tested for the University of Rome
  “Tor Vergata” site. The models are trained and validated using one year
  data. Through a cross training procedure, the dependence of the models on the
  training year is also analyzed. The performance of ST, NWP and MOS models,
  together with the benchmark Persistence Model (PM), are compared. The ST
  model and the NWP model exhibit similar results. Nevertheless different
  sources of forecast errors between ST and NWP models are identified. The MOS
  model gives the best performance, improving the forecast of approximately
  29{\%} with respect to the PM.%

  The correlations of Hottel, Whillier, Liu and Jordan between diffuse and
  hemispherical, and between instantaneous (hourly) values and daily totals of
  solar radiation are recalibrated against pyrheliometer data for five stations
  in the U.S. The validity of the Liu and Jordan approach is confirmed, and
  numerical inaccuracies of the original correlations are found to arise from
  three factors: (i) reliance on uncorrected measurements of diffuse insolation
  with pyranometer plus shade ring, (ii) use of a single value of
  extraterrestrial insolation for a whole month, and (iii) neglect of seasonal
  variations in the diffuse/hemispherical ratio. The new correlation for the
  daily total ratio of diffuse over hemispherical insolation agrees with
  results reported for India, Israel and Canada which included the shade ring
  correction. This suggests that latitude independence is a good approximation.
  The new correlations imply that the diffuse component is significantly larger
  than that predicted by the original formulas of Liu and Jordan. Analytical
  expressions are presented the parameters of which are obtained by a least
  squares fit to the data. The resulting formulas provide a complete
  description of the long term average insolation incident on surfaces of
  arbitrary orientation; the only meteorological input is the long term average
  daily total of hemispherical insolation on the horizontal surface. Comparison
  between model and data shows an accuracy better than 3 per cent for the long
  term average insolation available to solar correctors, both fixed and
  tracking. The model provides a framework for optimal matching between solar
  radiation and ideal concentrators (based on the principle of phase space
  conservation). In addition to computing radiation availability for solar
  collectors, the model can be used for calculating heating and cooling loads
  of buildings. {\textcopyright} 1979.%

  Building large solar power plants requires significant long-term investment
  so understanding impacts from climate change will aid financial planning,
  technology selection, and energy output projections. In this article we
  examine how projected changes in temperature and insolation over the 21st
  century will affect photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP)
  output. Projected climate data was obtained from the coupled ocean-atmosphere
  climate models HadGEM1 and HadCM3 under the IPCC SRES A1B scenario which
  describes a future world of rapid economic growth with a balanced use of
  renewable and fossil fuel power generation. Our calculations indicate that
  under this scenario PV output from 2010 to 2080 is likely to increase by a
  few percent in Europe and China, see little change in Algeria and Australia,
  and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. CSP output is
  likely to increase by more than 10{\%} in Europe, increase by several percent
  in China and a few percent in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few
  percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. The results are robust to
  uncertainty in projected temperature change. A qualitative analysis of
  uncertainty in projected insolation change suggests strongest confidence in
  the results for Europe and least confidence in the results for western USA.
  Changes in PV and CSP output are further studied by calculating fractional
  contributions from changes in temperature and insolation. For PV there is
  considerable variation in contribution depending on location. For CSP the
  contribution from changes in insolation is always dominant.%

  The high temporal variability of solar power is a real issue to achieve a
  balanced production and consumption. Solar power forecasting is then
  necessary to better exploit this variability and to increase the penetration
  of photovoltaic power into the energy mix. Solar energy forecasting involves
  prediction of cloud property above a given point. For several hour ahead
  forecasts, using images from meteorological geostationary satellite is the
  most suitable solution. We propose a forecasting method based on a phase
  correlation algorithm for motion estimation between subsequent cloud maps
  derived from Meteosat-9 images. The method is assessed against
  state-of-the-art over a limited area over South of France for a 4-hour
  period. Cloud index maps are predicted. Our forecasting are 21 {\%} better
  than persistence in relative RMSE of cloud index. If state-of-the-art shows
  better results (23 {\%}), our algorithm reduces computing of 25 {\%} and then
  minimize operational solar forecasting constraints.%

  This study is an analysis of the seasonal all-sky surface solar radiation
  variability in Europe during 19702000 using surface observations from the
  Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA). On the basis of the annual means period
  19701985, there is a statistically significant decline of 3.0{\%} decade1
  (3.8 Wm2 decade1) followed by a nonsignificant rise of 0.3{\%} decade1 (0.4
  Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. The behavior of the solar radiation for spring
  is similar to the annual series and has the strongest increase of 1.6{\%}
  decade1 (2.5 Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. In summer a similar evolution to
  the annual and spring time series is shown but has a stronger decline of
  3.2{\%} decade1 (6.8 Wm2 decade1) during 19701985. A small positive
  nonsignificant trend is reported for the winter means time series while a
  statistically significant negative trend of 2.5{\%} decade1 (2.1 Wm2 decade1)
  was found in autumn during 19702000. By comparing variations in all-sky solar
  radiation with changes in cloud cover and NAO, we attribute the winter and
  autumn trends mainly to the NAO through the modification of mid-to-low cloud
  cover in southern Europe and the spring and summer trends to mid-to-low cloud
  cover in northern Europe. However, because the cloud cover and solar
  radiation relationship weakens in the low-frequency variability, it suggests
  that other effects such as aerosols may also play a role. In addition,
  aerosols could be interfering with the relationship between solar radiation
  and NAO, contributing to a strengthening of their correlation in the
  low-frequency variability during winter and autumn.%

  The electricity sector is not only a substantial source of carbon emissions,
  but also vulnerable to climate change, both due to the growing share of
  renewables and due to temperature related changes in seasonal demand
  patterns. In this study we provide information on the impacts of +2°C global
  warming on heating and cooling electricity demand for 26 European countries,
  based on 11 EURO-CORDEX climate simulations, presenting mean changes but also
  weather-induced changes in peak demand. Smooth transition regression models
  are used to estimate the relationship between daily electricity consumption
  and population weighted temperature. Assuming present demographic and
  economic structures, global warming by 2°C reduces electricity consumption
  in most European countries. The reduced heating electricity demand outweighs
  the increase in cooling demand. The highest decrease in relative terms is
  found for Norway (up to −5.2{\%}), followed by Sweden, Estonia, Finland,
  and France. Italy is the only country for which an overall increase in
  electricity demand is projected. The decrease of electricity demand in
  absolute terms is projected to be by far the highest in France (between −10
  TWh and −16 TWh p. a.). In most countries peak demand of electricity for
  cooling and heating increases, whereby climate scenario uncertainties in case
  of heating are high. Altogether, a cross-country comparison heavily suggests
  that climate is not the main driver for the amount of electricity used for
  heating and cooling purposes, but rather energy policy.%

  The complementarity of two renewable energy sources, namely hydro and wind,
  is investigated. We consider the diversification effect of wind power to
  reduce the risk of water inflow shortages, an important energy security
  concern for hydropower-based economic zones (e.g. Qu{\'{e}}bec and Norway).
  Our risk measure is based on the probability of a production deficit, in a
  manner akin to the value-at-risk, simulation analysis of financial
  portfolios. We examine whether the risk level of a mixed hydro-and-wind
  portfolio of generating assets improves on the risk of an all-hydro
  portfolio, by relaxing the dependence on water inflows and attenuating the
  impact of droughts. Copulas are used to model the dependence between the two
  sources of energy. The data considered, over the period 1958-2003, are for
  the province of Qu{\'{e}}bec, which possesses large hydro and wind resources.
  Our results indicate that for all scenarios considered, any proportion of
  wind up to 30{\%} improves the production deficit risk profile of an
  all-hydro system. We can also estimate the value, in TW h, of any additional
  one percent of wind in the portfolio. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

  Med-CORDEX simulations over the period 1979--2011 are evaluated with regard
  to their capability to represent observed decadal variations over the
  Euro-Mediterranean region and improve upon previous generation simulations
  from the ENSEMBLES project in their various experimental set-ups. Such an
  evaluation is needed to inform the use of these simulations and also future
  model development. For temperature, both Med-CORDEX and ENSEMBLES simulations
  tend to provide comparable results: they generally capture the sign and
  timing of the anomalies but not the amplitude. In general, no clear
  stratification appears when considering different types of Med-CORDEX
  regional modeling systems. Rather, it is remarkable that certain periods are
  poorly represented by all systems with a general underestimation of the
  observed long-term temperature trend, mostly in the summer season, even with
  respect to the corresponding global drivers. For precipitation, the
  Med-CORDEX simulations are closer to observations than the other datasets,
  with some improvement with respect to ENSEMBLES dataset. In general, all the
  systems experience difficulties in representing anomalies during specific
  periods or for specific regions. These appear in part due to limitations in
  the reanalysis boundary forcing data. For instance, in the second part of
  1980s, the spatial patterns of surface air temperature during DJF/MAM are
  generally poorly represented, as well as the regionally averaged MAM/JJA
  surface air temperature decadal anomalies. Overall, the evaluation suggests
  limited improvement in Med-CORDEX simulations compared to ENSEMBLES, and a
  lack of sensitivity to resolution or coupling configuration, with persisting
  problems in part likely related to the representation of surface processes
  that could also affect the viability of future projections (e.g. the
  estimation of temperature trends). A set of decadal variability evaluation
  metrics, as applied in this study, could be useful in the context of a
  broader evaluation framework.%

  Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for
  unsupervised dimension reduction. K-means clustering is a commonly used data
  clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks. Here we prove that
  principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster
  membership indicators for K-means clustering. New lower bounds for K-means
  objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the
  eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. These results indicate that
  unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning.
  Several implications are discussed. On dimension reduction, the result
  provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data
  reductions, beyond the conventional noisereduction explanation that PCA, via
  singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear
  approximation of the data. On learning, the result suggests effective
  techniques for K-means data clustering. DNA gene expression and Internet
  newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results. Experiments indicate that
  the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5 of the optimal values.%

  Integration of solar energy into the electricity network is becoming
  essential because of its continually increasing growth in usage. An efficient
  use of the fluctuating energy output of photovoltaic (PV) systems requires
  reliable forecast information. In fact, this integration can offer a better
  quality of service if the solar irradiance variation can be predicted with
  great accuracy. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods
  used to forecast solar irradiance in order to facilitate selection of the
  appropriate forecast method according to needs. The study starts with a
  presentation of statistical approaches and techniques based on cloud images.
  Next numerical weather prediction or NWP models are detailed before
  discussing hybrid models. Finally, we give indications for future solar
  irradiance forecasting approaches dedicated to the management of small-scale

  A numerical approach to modeling climate on a regional scale is developed
  whereby large-scale weather systems are simulated with a global climate model
  (GCM) and the GCM output is used to provide the boundary conditions needed
  for high-resolution mesoscale model simulations over the region of interest.
  In our example, we use the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
  community climate model (CCM1) and the Pennsylvania State University
  (PSU)/NCAR Mesoscale Model version 4 (MM4) to apply this approach over the
  western United States (U.S.). The topography, as resolved by the 500-km mesh
  of the CCM1, is necessarily highly distorted, but with the 60-km mesh of the
  MM4 the major mountain ranges are distinguished. To obtain adequate and
  consistent representations of surface climate, we use the same radiation and
  land surface treatments in both models, the latter being the recently
  developed Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS). Our analysis
  emphasizes the simulation at four CCM1 points surrounding Yucca Mountain, NV,
  because of the need to determine its climatology prior to certification as a
  high-level nuclear waste repository.%

  The objective of this paper is to synthesize the large literature recording
  changing patterns of precipitation in the observed data, thus indicating that
  climate change is already a reality. Such a synthesis is required not only
  for environmental researchers but also for policy makers. The key question is
  the broad picture at major regional and continental levels. Some interesting
  conclusions for this survey are emerging. For example, the review shows
  increased variance of precipitation everywhere. Consistent with this finding,
  we observe that wet areas become wetter, and dry and arid areas become more
  so. In addition, the following general changing pattern is emerging: (a)
  increased precipitation in high latitudes (Northern Hemisphere); (b)
  reductions in precipitation in China, Australia and the Small Island States
  in the Pacific; and (c) increased variance in equatorial regions. The changes
  in the major ocean currents also appear to be affecting precipitation
  patterns. For example, increased intensity and frequency of El Ni{\~{n}}o and
  ENSO seem associated with evidence of an observed “dipole” pattern
  affecting Africa and Asia, although this time series is too short so far. But
  the changing pattern calls for renewed efforts at adaptation to climate
  change, as the changing precipitation pattern will also affect the regional
  availability of food supply.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Solar cell performance decreases with increasing temperature, fundamentally
  owing to increased internal carrier recombination rates, caused by increased
  carrier concentrations. The operating temperature plays a key role in the
  photovoltaic conversion process. Both the electrical efficiency and the power
  output of a photovoltaic (PV) module depend linearly on the operating
  temperature. The various correlations proposed in the literature represent
  simplified working equations which can be apply to PV modules or PV arrays
  mounted on free-standing frames, PV-Thermal collectors, and building
  integrated photovoltaic arrays, respectively. The electrical performance is
  primarily influenced by the material of PV used. Numerous correlations for
  cell temperature which have appeared in the literature involve basic
  environmental variables and numerical parameters which are material or system
  dependent. In this paper, a brief discussion is presented regarding the
  operating temperature of one-sun commercial grade silicon-based solar
  cells/modules and its effect upon the electrical performance of photovoltaic
  installations. Generally, the performance ratio decreases with latitude
  because of temperature. However, regions with high altitude have higher
  performance ratios due to low temperature, like, southern Andes, Himalaya
  region, and Antarctica. PV modules with less sensitivity to temperature are
  preferable for the high temperature regions and more responsive to
  temperature will be more effective in the low temperature regions. The
  geographical distribution of photovoltaic energy potential considering the
  effect of irradiation and ambient temperature on PV system performance is
  considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.%

  Australia has an abundant solar energy resource that is likely to be used for
  energy generation on a large scale. Variable sources of electricity
  generation require knowledge of the nature of their variability at all time
  scales. This study examines the effect that El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern
  Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have on solar radiation
  in Australia, in order to establish the role for seasonal forecasting of
  solar power. Calendar years are classified into their ENSO state using a sea
  surface temperature index. The ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis products are
  then used to estimate the effect of ENSO on global horizontal solar
  irradiance over the continent. A bootstrap technique is used to obtain
  confidence regions for the effect in both winter and summer. The main impact
  of ENSO occurs during winter over a large part of eastern Australia. Little
  impact was observed over the continent during summer. A similar analysis is
  conducted for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) to ensure that the observed ENSO
  effect is not a manifestation of the IOD. This study indicates that the ENSO
  phenomenon may account for solar energy changes of more than 10{\%} in some
  locations on a seasonal basis. We show that the solar radiation analysis is
  directly applicable to solar energy yield. Knowledge of this variability may
  influence the location of large solar generation plants. Also, there is a
  potential to predict solar energy a few months ahead by means of seasonal
  forecasting systems, which would help to assist with planning for electricity
  grid.%

  Twenty-eight years (1977–2004) of surface solar irradiance observations at
  five remote climate observatories are analyzed for long-term temporal
  variations and spatial representativeness. Autocorrelated temporal variations
  are suggested in the annual mean irradiance records at some of the sites and
  in normalized anomaly records for various combinations of the surface sites.
  These variations are illustrated by first-, second-, and third-degree
  polynomials as well as by a sinusoidal fit, all of which are used as data
  smoothers not necessarily representative of any related physical processes,
  although some fits yield statistically significant coefficients. In general,
  there is an indication of a decreasing tendency in the early portion of the
  records and then an increasing tendency until toward the very end of the
  record. Variations among field sites are seen, with the one Arctic site
  showing the most departure from the others, with primarily a downward trend
  for most of the record. The spatial representativeness of each site's annual
  mean record is investigated using spatial cross correlation with
  satellite-derived global estimates of the surface solar irradiance. These
  cross correlations show significant correlations with relatively large areas
  both contiguous and noncontiguous with the sites.%

  Abstract The history of climate modeling begins with conceptual models,
  followed in the 19th century by mathematical models of energy balance and
  radiative transfer, as well as simple analog models. Since the 1950s, the
  principal tools of climate science have been computer simulation models of
  the global general circulation. From the 1990s to the present, a trend toward
  increasingly comprehensive coupled models of the entire climate system has
  dominated the field. Climate model evaluation and intercomparison is changing
  modeling into a more standardized, modular process, presenting the potential
  for unifying research and operational aspects of climate science. WIREs Clim

  This study aims to assess the skill of regional climate models (RCMs) at
  reproducing the climatology of Mediterranean cyclones. Seven RCMs are
  considered, five of which were also coupled with an oceanic model. All
  simulations were forced at the lateral boundaries by the ERA-Interim
  reanalysis for a common 20-year period (1989--2008). Six different cyclone
  tracking methods have been applied to all twelve RCM simulations and to the
  ERA-Interim reanalysis in order to assess the RCMs from the perspective of
  different cyclone definitions. All RCMs reproduce the main areas of high
  cyclone occurrence in the region south of the Alps, in the Adriatic, Ionian
  and Aegean Seas, as well as in the areas close to Cyprus and to Atlas
  mountains. The RCMs tend to underestimate intense cyclone occurrences over
  the Mediterranean Sea and reproduce 24--40 {\{}{\%}{\}} of these systems, as
  identified in the reanalysis. The use of grid nudging in one of the RCMs is
  shown to be beneficial, reproducing about 60 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the intense
  cyclones and keeping a better track of the seasonal cycle of intense
  cyclogenesis. Finally, the most intense cyclones tend to be similarly
  reproduced in coupled and uncoupled model simulations, suggesting that
  modeling atmosphere--ocean coupled processes has only a weak impact on the
  climatology and intensity of Mediterranean cyclones.%

  Climate related energy sources such as wind, solar and runoff sources are
  variable in time and space, following their driving weather variables. High
  penetration of such energy sources might be facilitated by using their
  complementarity in order to increase the balance between energy load and
  generation. This study presents the analysis of the effect of a 100{\%}
  renewable energy mix composed by solar and run-of-the-river energy in
  Northern Italy where these two energy sources are the main alternative energy
  sources. Along a climate gradient from the Alpine crest (snow melt dominated
  area) to the Veneto plain (rainfall dominated area), solar power is generated
  in the flat plain, and run-of-the-river hydropower at two mountainous
  locations. Covering all possible mixes of these two sources, we analyze their
  complementarity across different temporal scales using two indicators: the
  standard deviation of the energy balance and the theoretical storage required
  for balancing generation and load. Results show that at small temporal scale
  (hourly), a high share of run-of-the-river power allows minimizing the energy
  balance variability. The opposite is obtained at larger temporal scales
  (daily and monthly) essentially because of lower variability of solar power
  generation, which also implies a lower storage requirement.%

  We have estimated the radiative impact produced by an unusually extreme dust
  and wildfire episode on the performance of a photovoltaic (PV) plant. The
  dust and wildfire events were mostly active on 26–28 and 29–30 June 2012,
  respectively. We took advantage of the consecutiveness of both events to
  separate and derive empirically the radiative effect of dust and smoke
  aerosols. With this purpose, we employed measurements of aerosol load,
  radiation and PV power output from a collocated atmospheric station and PV
  plant located at Burjassot (Valencia, Spain). The empirical estimates were
  obtained by direct comparison with a summer background day, happened right
  before the two consecutive case studies. The whole episode is characterized
  by high aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm, reaching values up to 1 and 6
  for dust and smoke, respectively. Our analysis shows an average daily energy
  loss of −132 kWh, that represents a fraction of 20{\%} of the energy
  generated by the PV plant on the reference summer background day. A
  significant fraction of the energy lost was due to smoke, with a daily
  maximum of 43{\%} and a daily average of 34{\%}. In case of dust, the energy
  reduction was moderated, with a daily average of 6{\%}. In terms of
  instantaneous power reduction, we have obtained peaks of 8 and 51{\%} for
  dust and smoke, respectively. The energy reduction due to aerosols is
  strongly dependent on AOD. Further, we have found that the power loss per
  unit of AOD at 870 nm is useful to separate the radiative impact of different
  aerosol types. Essentially, the efficiency of smoke to reduce the energy
  generated by the PV plant is much greater than that of dust. This effect is
  mainly due to the different optical properties in the near infrared that
  result in a daily Power Aerosol Forcing Efficiency at 870 nm of −5.7 and
  −19.1 kW, for dust and smoke, respectively. Our results indicate that both
  the AOD and aerosol type drive the radiative impact of aerosols on the PV
  output, confirming that extreme aerosol events may drastically reduce the
  power generated by operative PV plants. This reduction may be as large as
  that reported for particle soiling. Therefore, considering both amount and
  type of aerosols in the PV power analyses is mandatory in order to obtain
  accurate forecast scenarios and improve the grid integration, especially
  during extreme episodes.%

  The near future change in productivity of photovoltaic energy (PVE) in Europe
  and Africa is assessed by using the climate variables simulated by the
  ECHAM5-HAM aerosol-climate model, and a model for the performance of
  photovoltaic systems. The climate simulations are forced by green-house gases
  emissions from the IPCC SRES B2 scenario. In addition, different scenarios
  for future anthropogenic aerosols emissions are applied. Thus, the
  sensitivity of the future PVE productivity to changes in aerosol atmospheric
  burdens between 2000 and 2030 is analyzed. The analysis indicates that
  reductions in aerosols emissions in the near future result in an increase of
  global warming, and a significant response in surface solar radiation and
  associated PVE productivity. A statistically significant reduction in PVE
  productivity up to 7{\%} is observed in eastern Europe and northern Africa,
  while a significant increase up to 10{\%} is observed in western Europe and
  eastern Mediterranean. The changes in surface solar radiation and PVE
  productivity are related to global effects of aerosols reduction on the large
  scale circulation and associated cloud cover pattern, rather than to local
  effects on the atmospheric optical properties. PVE assessment is then
  discussed in the frame of the present situation and next decades evolution of
  the photovoltaic market, highlighting that the effects on productivity
  induced by industrial and public policies, and technological development are
  comparable to climate related effects. The presented results encourage the
  improvement and further use of climate models in assessment of future
  renewable energies availability.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Medicanes are cyclones over the Mediterranean Sea having a tropical-like
  structure but a rather small size, that can produce significant damage due to
  the combination of intense winds and heavy precipitation. Future climate
  projections, performed generally with individual atmospheric climate models,
  indicate that the intensity of the medicanes could increase under climate
  change conditions. The availability of large ensembles of high resolution and
  ocean--atmosphere coupled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, performed
  in MedCORDEX and EURO-CORDEX projects, represents an opportunity to improve
  the assessment of the impact of climate change on medicanes. As a first step
  towards such an improved assessment, we analyze the ability of the RCMs used
  in these projects to reproduce the observed characteristics of medicanes, and
  the impact of increased resolution and air-sea coupling on their simulation.
  In these storms, air-sea interaction plays a fundamental role in their
  formation and intensification, a different mechanism from that of
  extra-tropical cyclones, where the baroclinic instability mechanism prevails.
  An observational database, based on satellite images combined with high
  resolution simulations (Miglietta et al. in Geophys Res Lett 40:2400--2405,
  2013), is used as a reference for evaluating the simulations. In general, the
  simulated medicanes do not coincide on a case-by-case basis with the observed
  medicanes. However, observed medicanes with a high intensity and relatively
  long duration of tropical characteristics are better replicated in
  simulations. The observed spatial distribution of medicanes is generally well
  simulated, while the monthly distribution reveals the difficulty of
  simulating the medicanes that first appear in September after the summer
  minimum in occurrence. Increasing the horizontal resolution has a systematic
  and generally positive impact on the frequency of simulated medicanes, while
  the general underestimation of their intensity is not corrected in most
  cases. The capacity of a few models to better simulate the medicane intensity
  suggests that the model formulation is more important than reducing the grid
  spacing alone. A negative intensity feedback is frequently the result of
  air-sea interaction for tropical cyclones in other basins. The introduction
  of air-sea coupling in the present simulations has an overall limited impact
  on medicane frequency and intensity, but it produces an interesting seasonal
  shift of the simulated medicanes from autumn to winter. This fact, together
  with the analysis of two contrasting particular cases, indicates that the
  negative feedback could be limited or even absent in certain situations. We
  suggest that the effects of air-sea interaction on medicanes may depend on
  the oceanic mixed layer depth, thus increasing the applicability of
  ocean--atmosphere coupled RCMs for climate change analysis of this kind of
  cyclones.%

  Solar energy is one of the more abundant sources of renewable energy. It
  would be desirable that it is more stable over time than other energies with
  high interannual variability like hydropower. In this study we analyse the
  interannual variability of sunshine hours and precipitation over Spain, with
  the aim of comparing the reliability of solar energy to hydropower. An
  analysis in this respect has not been done before. We have used data from
  almost 100 stations in the WMO-AEMET (Spanish State Agency for Meteorology)
  network, and have applied two indices, the coefficient of variability (CV)
  and the speed of convergence, defined as the number of years of data needed
  to fully characterize a site. The main result is that the interannual
  variability for sunshine hours is several times lower than for precipitation
  over most of Spain, with the exception of the northern coast. The
  southwestern peninsular area stands out in this respect. This area is
  characterized at the same time by the highest number of sunshine hours, high
  speed of convergence and a low maximum departure of annual sunshine hours
  from the long-term mean. All this make this area optimal and very reliable
  for placing solar power plants.%

  As solar energy will be an increasingly important renewable energy source in
  future years, the study of how climate change affects both its temporal and
  spatial variability is very relevant. In this paper, we study future changes
  of the solar radiation resource in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) through a set
  of simulations from ESCENA project (generation of regionalized scenarios of
  climate change in Spain with high-resolution models) until mid-century. The
  evaluation of the simulations against observations indicates contrasting
  biases for the different regional climate models (RCMs) in terms of solar
  irradiation amount and its inter-annual variability. We propose a diagnostic
  for the quality of solar energy resource, in which the gridpoints are
  classified in four categories depending on the combination of solar
  irradiation amount and variability. The observed large percentage of points
  in the optimal category (high irradiation/low variability) in the IP is
  well-captured by the RCMs in general terms. The analysis of scenarios
  indicates a future increase in solar irradiation, although not all scenarios
  agree in the geographical distribution of this increase. The quality of solar
  energy resource is projected to increase, mostly due to a decrease in
  variability. This is an important result, as a more stable inter-annual
  resource should decrease the need for backup sources and also reduce
  inter-annual electricity price variations. Finally, results from a first
  approximation to the issue of the ability of solar energy to cover power
  demand peaks in summer show important differences between regions of the IP.
  However, the spatially averaged correlation of solar irradiation and summer
  surface temperatures for the whole IP is rather high, which is a positive
  result as the strong interconnections of the power grid within the IP could
  allow a distribution of solar power surpluses in certain regions for such
  high-temperature episodes.%

  Abstract A Limited Area Model (LAM) is nested in a General Circulation Model
  (GCM) to simulate the January climate over the western United States. In the
  nesting procedure, the GCM output is used to provide the initial and lateral
  atmospheric boundary conditions necessary to drive the LAM. In this approach,
  the GCM is used to simulate realistic large-scale atmospheric behavior over
  an area of interest and the LAM to describe the effect of local, sub-GCM grid
  scale forcings (such as those induced by the complex western United States
  topography) on regional patterns of climatic variables. Two versions of the
  National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model [the
  seasonal CCM1 at 4.5° × 7.5° (R15) and 2.89° × 2.89° (T42)
  latitude-longitude resolution] are used to drive a version of the
  Pennsylvania State University/NCAR mesoscale model (MM4 at 60 km resolution),
  which includes sophisticated soil hydrology calculations. The CCM1
  large-scale January climatology over the region is analyzed first. Comparison
  with large-scale observations shows that geopotential height, zonal wind,
  temperature, relative humidity, cloudiness, precipitation and storm
  frequencies over the western United States and adjacent oceans are
  realistically simulated by both the T42 and R15 models. The T42 model,
  however, reproduces storm frequencies and strength and position of the jet
  stream better than the R15 model. A number of month-long January simulations
  were performed using both the R15 and T42 model outputs to drive the MM4. The
  large-scale average circulations over the western United States simulated by
  the nested MM4 are not substantially different from those of the driving
  CCM1, both when outputs from the R15 and T42 versions are used to drive the
  MM4. Owing to the more realistic topography in the MM4, the nested model
  system produces better regional detail of precipitation and temperature
  distribution than the CCM1 alone. Temperature and precipitation means, as
  well as frequencies of daily precipitation intensifies simulated by the
  nested MM4, compare well with high resolution observations, particularly in
  their spatial distribution. Also discussed am results of regional snow cover,
  cloudiness, and soil hydrology calculations included in the MM4.%

  We present a review of climate change projections over the Mediterranean
  region based on the most recent and comprehensive ensembles of global and
  regional climate change simulations completed as part of international
  collaborative projects. A robust and consistent picture of climate change
  over the Mediterranean emerges, consisting of a pronounced decrease in
  precipitation, especially in the warm season, except for the northern
  Mediterranean areas (e.g. the Alps) in winter. This drying is due to
  increased anticyclonic circulation that yields increasingly stable conditions
  and is associated with a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track. A
  pronounced warming is also projected, maximum in the summer season.
  Inter-annual variability is projected to mostly increase especially in
  summer, which, along with the mean warming, would lead to a greater
  occurrence of extremely high temperature events. The projections by the
  global and regional model simulations are generally consistent with each
  other at the broad scale. However, the precipitation change signal produced
  by the regional models shows substantial orographically-induced fine scale
  structure absent in the global models. Overall, these change signals are
  robust across forcing scenarios and future time periods, with the magnitude
  of the signal increasing with the intensity of the forcing. The intensity and
  robustness of the climate change signals produced by a range of global and
  regional climate models suggest that the Mediterranean might be an especially
  vulnerable region to global change.%

  Results are presented from high resolution climate change simulations over
  the Mediterranean region using the ICTP Regional Climate Model, RegCM3. Two
  sets of multi-decadal simulations are performed at 20-km grid spacing for
  present day and future climate (IPCC A2 scenario). We analyze changes in
  precipitation mean and extremes and find that the change signal shows
  seasonally dependent fine scale structure in response to the topographic
  forcing and changes in circulation, especially over the Alpine region and the
  Iberian, Italian and Hellenic peninsulas. In winter, the mean precipitation
  change is positive in the Northern Mediterranean regions and negative in the
  Southern Mediterranean, while precipitation in the other seasons mostly
  decreases (especially in summer), except over some localized areas. Changes
  in extreme precipitation events and dry spells suggest not only shifts, but
  also a broadening, of the precipitation distribution, with an increased
  probability of occurrence of events conducive to both floods and droughts.%

  The intrinsic performance of 18 broadband radiative models is assessed, using
  high-quality datasets from five sites in widely different climates. The
  selected models can predict direct, diffuse and global irradiances under
  clear skies from atmospheric data, and have all been (or still are) involved
  in large-scale applications, for instance to prepare solar resource maps and
  datasets, or to evaluate solar radiation in GIS software. The input data to
  the models include accurate aerosol and water vapor measurements by
  collocated sunphotometers, if needed. Cloud occurrences are meticulously
  scrutinized through the use of various tools to avoid cloud contamination of
  the test data. The intrinsic performance of the models is evaluated by
  comparison between their predictions and measurements at high frequency
  (1-minute time step at four sites, 3-minute at one site). The total expanded
  uncertainty of these measurements is estimated at 3{\%} for direct
  irradiance, and 5{\%} for diffuse and global irradiance.Various statistics
  are calculated to evaluate the systematic and random differences between the
  data series, as well as the agreement between the cumulative distribution
  functions. In the latter case, stringent statistics based on the
  Komolgorov-Smirnov (KS) test are used. Large differences in performance are
  apparent between models. Those that require more atmospheric inputs perform
  usually better than simpler models. Whereas many models can predict the
  global horizontal irradiance within uncertainty limits similar to those of
  the radiation measurements, the prediction of direct irradiance is less
  accurate. Moreover, the prediction of diffuse horizontal irradiance is
  particularly deficient in most models. The cumulative distribution functions
  also denote areas of concern.A ranking of all models is proposed, based on
  four statistical indicators: mean bias difference (MBD), root mean square
  difference (RMSD), total uncertainty with 95{\%} confidence limits (U 95),
  and the newly introduced Combined Performance Index (CPI), which optimally
  combines two KS indices with RMSD. For direct irradiance, consistently high
  rankings are obtained with five models (REST2, Ineichen, Hoyt, Bird, and
  Iqbal-C, in decreasing order of performance) that require a relatively large
  number of atmospheric inputs. The inferior performance of models requiring
  little or no atmospheric inputs suggests that large-scale solar resource
  products derived from them may be inappropriate for serious solar
  applications. Additionally, prediction uncertainties under ideal clear-sky
  conditions can propagate and affect all-sky predictions as well-resulting in
  potential biases in existing solar resource maps at the continent scale, for
  instance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.%

  {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Renewable energy resources are variable by
  nature. Due to this fact conventional electricity systems, which were
  designed for centralized generation, have to follow a different management
  approach when a big share of these technologies take part into the system.
  The space-time variability characteristics of solar radiation, wind and
  precipitation are very different and a detailed understanding of them is
  important for an adequate planning and management of the electricity system.
  This paper is focused on solar irradiation as source of energy for
  photovoltaic (PV) generation, but the proposed scheme can generally be
  applied to other renewable resources and different solar irradiation
  applications. A comprehensive methodology to analyze variability and
  complementarity of solar resource and PV production among sub-regions of a
  wide area is developed. The photovoltaic energy yield is defined as kWh per
  kW installed, which facilitates the comparison among sub-regions and allows a
  comparison with other renewable energies like solar thermoelectric or wind
  energy. The multi-step approach facilitates the spatial evaluation and
  comparison among areas and it could be applied to different time resolutions,
  from a short term analysis to climatological perspective as well as a climate
  change projections analysis. The main steps of the method are the application
  of an objective clustering method for performing a regionalization of the
  whole domain, the ana lysis of the temporal variability of solar radiation
  and photovoltaic energy yield, and the intercomparison of the obtained
  clusters for examining their complementarity. As an implementation example,
  we make use of 30 years of daily satellite data, which is usually considered
  as the time for defining a climatology, and a long-term overview of solar
  variability is analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). In this region, the
  internal interconnections of the electrical system are strong, but the
  external interconnections are rather limited. The spatial distribution and
  variability of photovoltaic (PV) power yield is calculated for different
  tracking systems. The variability is analyzed on an interannual time scale,
  which is relevant for energy supply security and year-to-year price
  stability. The interannual variability shows robustness and stability of
  solar radiation and PV production on average for the whole domain, but with
  significant differences among clusters that could allow spatial compensation
  of PV production. The relationship between the variability of solar
  irradiation and of PV yield is not uniform among the different clusters.
  Areas where solar irradiation is higher are more sensitive to tracking type.
  The whole process described in the article provides the information of how
  solar resource and the PV energy yield perform in a limited area and provide
  the tools to analyze the relationships between sub-areas and their
  variability. In this sense, this method can be applied for isolated or nearly
  isolated electric systems located in regions with a variety of climates, or
  for interconnected systems involving several countries.%

  The increase in the photovoltaic energy installed capacity over the world
  leads to the need of a better understanding of solar resource and its
  variability. The aim of this work is to assess the influence of aerosols on
  photovoltaic energy production from seasonal to multi-decadal time scales.
  For this purpose we use various coupled aerosol-climate simulations that take
  into account the complex spatial and temporal patterns of natural and
  anthropogenic aerosols over the Euro-Mediterranean domain. The results show
  that aerosols strongly influence the spatial pattern, seasonal cycle and
  long-term trend of PV production. The most affected area is Central Europe
  where sensitivity of PV production to aerosols is higher. The annual
  production loss due to aerosols ranges from no impact to -16{\%} in The
  Netherlands, with variation depending on the area and on the typology of the
  tracking system. The summer production loss can even reach -20{\%} over
  regions of Africa and Syria-Iraq. We conclude that aerosols cannot be
  neglected in the assessment of PV production at large time scales over the
  Euro-Mediterranean area. Besides, the potential increase in energy due to
  reduction in the anthropogenic aerosols is shown in the simulation of the
  brightening period over Europe, with an increase of 2000 kWhkWp in a PV
  lifetime for the most affected areas. It illustrates the evolution that PV
  potential could follow in highly polluted areas through the effective
  implementation of pollution control measures.%

  The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is responding to a growing
  demand for high-accuracy solar resource data with uncertainties significantly
  lower than those of existing solar resource datasets, such as the National
  Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Measurements for long-term solar resource
  characterizations require years to complete, which is an unacceptable
  timeline for the rapidly emerging needs of renewable energy applications.
  This contribution seeks methods of reducing the uncertainty of existing
  long-term solar resource datasets by incorporating lower-uncertainty
  site-specific ground measurements of a limited period of record. In
  particular, various techniques are being explored to make full use of the
  existing high-resolution radiation data available in the NSRDB and other
  sources, and extrapolate them over time using locally measured data and other
  supportive information. The interannual variability in global and direct
  radiation is studied here using long-term data at various sites. NSRDB's
  modeled data for the 1998-2005 period are compared to quality-controlled
  measurements to assess the performance of the model, which is found to vary
  greatly depending on climatic condition. The reported results are encouraging
  for applications involving concentrators at very sunny sites. Large seasonal
  biases are found at some cloudy sites. Various improvements are proposed to
  enhance the quality of the existing model and modeled data. The measurement
  of solar radiation to characterize the solar climate for renewable energy and
  other applications is a time consuming and expensive operation. Full climate
  characterization may require several decades of measurements-a prospect that
  is not practical for an industry intent on rapid deployment of solar
  technologies. This study demonstrates that the consistency of the solar
  resource in both time and space varies widely across the United States. The
  mapped results here illustrate regions with high and low variability and
  provide readers with quick visual information to help them decide where and
  how long measurements should be taken for a particular application. The
  underlying data that form these maps are also available from NREL to provide
  users the opportunity for more detailed analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011.%

  Abstract Means and trends of shortwave irradiance at the earth's surface are
  calculated from pyranometer measurements stored in the Global Energy Balance
  Archive (GEBA) database. The GEBA database contains the most comprehensive
  set of shortwave irradiance monthly means. The relative random error of
  measurement is approximately 5{\%} of a monthly mean in general and
  approximately 2{\%} of a yearly mean. The shortwave irradiance yearly means
  are analyzed in a 2.5° × 2.5° grid. In average example grid cells in
  Europe (no large altitude differences, no coasts), the difference of
  shortwave irradiance yearly means measured at different stations (station
  effect) is less than 5{\%} of the cell mean, and the interannual variability
  is approximately 4{\%} of the cell mean. On most continents, shortwave
  irradiance decreases significantly in large regions, and significant positive
  trends are observed only in four small regions.%

  Wind energy is susceptible to global climate change because it could alter
  the wind patterns. Then, improvement of our knowledge of wind field
  variability is crucial to optimize the use of wind resources in a given
  region. Here, we quantify the effects of climate change on the surface wind
  speed field over the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands using an ensemble
  of four regional climate models driven by a global climate model. Regions of
  the Iberian Peninsula with coherent temporal variability in wind speed in
  each of the models are identified and analysed using cluster analysis. These
  regions are continuous in each model and exhibit a high degree of overlap
  across the models. The models forced by the European Reanalysis Interim
  (ERA-Interim) reanalysis are validated against the European Climate
  Assessment and Dataset wind. We find that regional models are able to
  simulate with reasonable skill the spatial distribution of wind speed at 10 m
  in the Iberian Peninsula, identifying areas with common wind variability.
  Under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B climate change
  scenario, the wind speed in the identified regions for 2031–2050 is up to
  5{\%} less than during the 1980–1999 control period for all models. The
  models also agree on the time evolution of spatially averaged wind speed in
  each region, showing a negative trend for all of them. These tendencies
  depend on the region and are significant at p = 5{\%} or slightly more for
  annual trends, while seasonal trends are not significant in most of the
  regions and seasons. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons,

  This study evaluates the Mediterranean Sea heat budget components from a set
  of forced and coupled simulations performed in the frame of the Med-CORDEX
  project. The simulations use regional climate system models (RCSMs) dedicated
  to the Mediterranean area and driven by the ERA40/ERA-Interim reanalyses. The
  study focuses on the period 1980--2010. Interannual variations of the average
  net heat flux at the sea surface are consistent among models but the spread
  in the mean values is large (from −4.8 to +2.2 Wm−2) with the coupled
  models showing the lowest heat loss from the sea. For the heat flux at the
  Strait of Gibraltar both interannual variations and mean values show a large
  intermodel spread. The basin average temperature shows positive trends with
  highest values in the coupled models; it also shows interannual variations
  that are in good agreement with observations. The heat content rate is
  calculated based on the derivative of the average temperature and is found to
  be significantly correlated for most models with the net heat flux at the sea
  surface (average correlation {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.5) but not
  with the net heat flux through the Strait of Gibraltar (average correlation
  {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.2), suggesting that in the considered
  RCSMs the interannual variability of the heat content rate is mainly driven
  by the surface heat fluxes. The resemblance between the simulated and
  observed heat content rates is stronger in the forced models than in the
  coupled ones. This is explained by the stronger constraint applied to the
  forced models by the use of the surface temperature relaxation to
  observations. The temperature of the outflowing water through the Strait of
  Gibraltar shows positive and significant trends, also higher in the coupled
  models. It is suggested that the Mediterranean Sea warming found in most
  models and in particular in the coupled ones, induces a change of the
  hydrographic conditions that affects the Strait of Gibraltar.%

  We present a European land-only daily high-resolution gridded data set for
  precipitation and minimum, maximum, and mean surface temperature for the
  period 1950–2006. This data set improves on previous products in its
  spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations,
  and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial
  interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered
  on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as
  well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in
  use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box
  averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We
  employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the
  monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using
  three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies
  using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an
  external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily
  estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily
  standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across
  the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number
  of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on
  the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal
  reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with
  return periods up to 10 years.%

  Applied power system research is data intensive, often requiring hour-by-hour

  AbstractThe land area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea has experienced 10 of
  the 12 driest winters since 1902 in just the last 20 years. A change in
  wintertime Mediterranean precipitation toward drier conditions has likely
  occurred over 1902–2010 whose magnitude cannot be reconciled with internal
  variability alone. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing are key
  attributable factors for this increased drying, though the external signal
  explains only half of the drying magnitude. Furthermore, sea surface
  temperature (SST) forcing during 1902–2010 likely played an important role
  in the observed Mediterranean drying, and the externally forced drying signal
  likely also occurs through an SST change signal.The observed wintertime
  Mediterranean drying over the last century can be understood in a simple
  framework of the region's sensitivity to a uniform global ocean warming and
  to modest changes in the ocean's zonal and meridional SST gradients. Climate
  models subjected to a uniform +0.5°C warming of the world oceans induce
  eastern Mediterranean drying but fail to generate the observed widespread
  Mediterranean drying pattern. For a +0.5°C SST warming confined to tropical
  latitudes only, a dry signal spanning the entire Mediterranean region occurs.
  The simulated Mediterranean drying intensifies further when the Indian Ocean
  is warmed +0.5°C more than the remaining tropical oceans, an enhanced drying
  signal attributable to a distinctive atmospheric circulation response
  resembling the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The extent
  to which these mechanisms and the region's overall drying since 1902 reflect
  similar mechanisms operating in association with external radiative forcing
  are discussed.%

  The concept and description of a remote sensing aerosol monitoring network
  initiated by NASA, developed to support NASA, CNES, and NASDA's Earth
  satellite systems under the name AERONET and expanded by national and
  international collaboration, is described. Recent development of
  weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable
  frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and
  precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements
  via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS' Data Collection Systems
  allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75{\%}
  of the Earth's surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage
  will increase to 90{\%} in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time
  processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the
  emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the
  project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open
  access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical
  interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for
  ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these
  measurements. The system's automatic data acquisition, transmission, and
  processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and
  global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies,
  radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals.
  This article discusses the operation and philosophy of the monitoring system,
  the precision and accuracy of the measuring radiometers, a brief description
  of the processing system, and access to the database.%

  This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate the maximum short-term
  output variability that an arbitrary fleet of PV systems places on any
  considered power grid. The paper begins with a model that demonstrates that
  the maximum possible variability for N identical, uncorrelated PV systems
  equals the total installed capacity divided by 2N. The paper then describes a
  general methodology that is applicable to arbitrary PV fleets. A key input to
  this generalized approach is the correlation, or absence thereof, existing
  between individual installations in the fleet at the considered variability
  time scale. In this respect, the article includes a presentation of new
  experimental evidence from hourly satellite-derived irradiances relating
  distance and fluctuation time scales in three geographic regions in the
  United States (Southwest, Southern Great Plains, and Hawaii) and from recent
  high density network measurements that both confirm and extend conclusions
  from previous studies, namely: (1) correlation coefficients decrease
  predictably with increasing distance, (2) correlation coefficients decrease
  at a similar rate when evaluated versus distance divided by the considered
  variability time scale, and (3) the accuracy of results is improved by
  including an implied cloud speed term.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  In Ontario (Canada), the integration of renewable power is a priority policy
  goal. Since 2004, the circumstances under which the integration of renewable
  power is evaluated have changed due to successive changes in price as well as
  concerns that its over-production may add to grid congestion. This research
  investigates the value of increasing complementarity (both proximate and
  geographically dispersed) of wind and solar resources as a means by which
  electricity planners and researchers might advance electricity sustainability
  in Ontario. More specifically, this paper asks the following questions: 1)
  Does the combination of solar and wind resources in selected locations in
  Ontario serve to ‘smooth out' power production, i.e., decrease instances of
  both high and low values, as compared to either resource producing
  individually? 2) Can this ‘smoothness' be further improved by dispersing
  these resources geographically amongst locations? and 3) Does increasing the
  number of locations with solar and wind resources further ‘smooth out'
  power production? Three years (2003–2005) of synchronous, hourly
  measurements of solar irradiance and wind speeds from Environment Canada's
  Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) are used to derive
  dimensionless indices for four locations in Ontario (Toronto, Wiarton, Sault
  Ste. Marie and Ottawa). These indices are used to develop three transparent
  and accessible methods of analysis: (1) graphical representation; (2)
  percentile ranking; and (3) using a theoretical maximum as a proxy for
  capacity. The article concludes that the combination of solar and wind within
  locations and amongst two locations improves ‘smoothness' in power
  production, as compared to when each resource is produced on its own;
  moreover, it is further improved once more than two resources and two
  locations are combined. However, there is neither further benefit, nor
  drawback, associated with the geographic dispersion of complementarity
  between solar in one location and wind in another, when compared to both
  resources in one location.%

  In the field of solar energy applications, the use of geostationary satellite
  images becomes crucial, since they allow the retrieval of irradiance at the
  surface, with the best possible spatial and temporal coverage. This study,
  conducted on data from 18 European and Mediterranean sites, over 8 years of
  data shows that it is now possible to retrieve hourly global and beam
  irradiance data with a low uncertainty, typically 17{\%} for the global, and
  34{\%} for the beam component, with a negligible bias.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A new high-resolution regional climate change ensemble has been established
  for Europe within the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional
  Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) initiative. The first set of simulations
  with a horizontal resolution of 12.5 km was completed for the new emission
  scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with more simulations expected to follow. The aim
  of this paper is to present this data set to the different communities active
  in regional climate modelling, impact assessment and adaptation. The
  EURO-CORDEX ensemble results have been compared to the SRES A1B simulation
  results achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns of
  changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in all three
  scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which can partly be related
  to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX. The results strengthen those
  obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need further investigations. The analysis of
  impact indices shows that for RCP8.5, there is a substantially larger change
  projected for temperature-based indices than for RCP4.5. The difference is
  less pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the increased
  resolution can be regarded as an added value of regional climate simulations.
  Regional climate model simulations provide higher daily precipitation
  intensities, which are completely missing in the global climate model
  simulations, and they provide a significantly different climate change of
  daily precipitation intensities resulting in a smoother shift from weak to
  moderate and high intensities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).%

  Europe is investing considerably in renewable energies for a sustainable
  future, with both Iberian countries (Portugal and Spain) promoting
  significantly new hydropower, wind, and solar plants. The climate variability
  in this area is highly controlled by just a few large-scale teleconnection
  modes. However, the relationship between these modes and the renewable
  climate-dependent energy resources has not yet been established in detail.
  The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the North Atlantic
  Oscillation (NAO) on the interannual variability of the main and primary
  renewable energy resources in Iberia. This is achieved through a holistic
  assessment that is based on a 10-km-resolution climate simulation spanning
  the period 1959–2007 that provides physically consistent data of the
  various magnitudes involved. A monthly analysis for the ex- tended winter
  (October–March) months shows that negativeNAOphases enhance wind speeds
  (10{\%}–15{\%}) and, thereby, wind power (estimated around 30{\%} at
  typical wind-turbine altitudes) and hydropower re- sources (with changes in
  precipitation exceeding 100{\%} and implying prolonged responses in reservoir
  storage and release throughout the year), while diminishing the solar
  potential (10{\%}–20{\%}). Opposite signals were also sporadically
  identified, being well explained when taking into account the orography and
  the prevailing wind direction during bothNAOphases.Anadditional analysis
  using real wind, hydropower, and solar power generation data further confirms
  the strong signature of the NAO.%

  Renewable energies arise as part of both economic development plans and
  mitigation strategies aimed at abating climate change. Contrariwise, most
  renewable energies are potentially vulnerable to climate change, which could
  affect in particular solar and wind power. Proper evaluations of this two-way
  climate-renewable energy relationship require detailed information of the
  geographical location of the renewable energy fleets. However, this
  information is usually provided as total amounts installed per administrative
  region, especially with respect to future planned installations. To help
  overcome this limiting issue, the objective of this contribution was to
  develop the so-called CLIMIX model: a tool that performs a realistic spatial
  allocation of given amounts of both photovoltaic (PV) and wind power
  installed capacities and evaluates the energy generated under varying climate
  conditions. This is done over a regular grid so that the created scenarios
  can be directly used in conjunction with outputs of climate models. First, we
  used the 0.44° resolution grid defined for the EURO-CORDEX project and
  applied the CLIMIX model to spatially allocate total amounts of both
  unreported 2012 and future 2020 PV and wind power installations in Europe at
  the country level. Second, we performed a validation exercise using the
  various options for estimating PV and wind power production under the created
  scenarios that are included in the model. The results revealed an acceptable
  agreement between the estimated and the recorded power production values in
  every European country. Lastly, we estimated increases in power production
  derived from the future deployment of new renewable units, often obtaining
  non-direct relationships. This latter further emphasizes the need of accurate
  spatially-resolved PV and wind power scenarios in order to perform reliable
  estimations of power production.%

  Ambitious climate change mitigation plans call for a significant increase in
  the use of renewables, which could, however, make the supply system more
  vulnerable to climate variability and changes. Here we evaluate climate
  change impacts on solar photovoltaic (PV) power in Europe using the recent
  EURO-CORDEX ensemble of high-resolution climate projections together with a
  PV power production model and assuming a well-developed European PV power
  fleet. Results indicate that the alteration of solar PV supply by the end of
  this century compared with the estimations made under current climate
  conditions should be in the range (-14{\%};+2{\%}), with the largest
  decreases in Northern countries. Temporal stability of power generation does
  not appear as strongly affected in future climate scenarios either, even
  showing a slight positive trend in Southern countries. Therefore, despite
  small decreases in production expected in some parts of Europe, climate
  change is unlikely to threaten the European PV sector.%

  Here we present the first assessment of climate change impacts on the
  temporal variability of the joint production of wind and solar photovoltaic
  (PV) power across Europe. For that we adopted regional and continental
  perspectives (assuming a single European electricity grid), considered
  several temporal frequencies (from daily to annual), used state-of-the-art
  regional climate projections together with a climate-production model, and
  assumed a future massive deployment of wind and PV power installations.
  Results support that the spatio-temporal complementarity between the wind and
  solar resources helps to minimize the temporal variability of the combined
  production under both present (1971–2000) and future (2070–2099) climate
  conditions similarly. Thus the projected changes are overall negligible (well
  below ±5{\%}). However, an additional assessment of theoretical upper/bottom
  bounds for these changes indicated significant potential increases in the
  stability of the joint production ranging from 5 to 25{\%} across regions,
  15{\%} at the continental scale. This would be subordinated to the
  feasibility of reaching, with the future deployment strategies, individual
  wind and PV power production series with a perfect temporal anticorrelation.
  These results may encourage stakeholders to take holistically optimized
  decisions.%

  The analysis of the influence of future climatic variations on air quality
  needs of methods that give a space-time display of large atmospheric data
  related to air pollution. Here a new approach in order to assess the impacts
  of climate change on the patterns of variation of secondary inorganic
  aerosols (SIA) over Europe is presented. The most widely used method of
  analysis (selected time-slices, future-minus-present method) is very
  sensitive to the chosen control and future periods because of the internal
  variability of the climate system. In order to overcome this limitation, full
  transient simulations for the period 1991-2100 under the SRES A2 scenario are
  analysed by the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) methodology in order
  minimise the uncertainty associated to the internal variability due to the
  longer time series obtained. The results indicate that the EOF1 accounts for
  around 30-45{\%} of the total variance for the SIA levels and points out a
  general increase of its trend over the entire domain (p{\textless} 0.005),
  except in the case of nitrate, whose change signal is not significant
  (p{\textgreater} 0.1). The correlation between SIA and meteorological
  parameters indicates that the trends and patterns of variation of aerosols
  are related to the higher temperature projected for the future climate. It
  favours the formation of sulphates and ammonium (increasing the
  concentrations of atmospheric oxidants) and the decomposition of ammonium
  nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the decreases in precipitation
  have a strong effect on the frequency of the washout and therefore in the
  levels of aerosols. The concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing
  precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. The trend
  from a decreasing mixing height found in several areas of Europe is
  frequently related to a decrease in precipitation, representing an adding
  effect for the enhanced future SIA concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2010

  Lett. 8 044035 Abstract The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East
  Atlantic (EA) and the Scandinavian (SCAND) modes are the three main
  large-scale circulation patterns driving the climate variability of the
  Iberian Peninsula. This study assesses their influence in terms of solar
  (photovoltaic) and wind power generation potential (SP and WP) and evaluates
  their skill as predictors. For that we use a hindcast regional climate
  simulation to retrieve the primary meteorological variables involved, surface
  solar radiation and wind speed. First we identify that the maximum influence
  of the various modes occurs on the interannual variations of the monthly mean
  SP and WP series, being generally more relevant in winter. Second we find
  that in this time-scale and season, SP (WP) varies up to 30{\%} (40{\%}) with
  respect to the mean climatology between years with opposite phases of the
  modes, although the strength and the spatial distribution of the signals
  differ from one month to another. Last, the skill of a multi-linear
  regression model (MLRM), built using the NAO, EA and SCAND indices, to
  reconstruct the original wintertime monthly series of SP and WP was
  investigated. The reconstructed series (when the MLRM is calibrated for each
  month individually) correlate with the original ones up to 0.8 at the
  interannual time-scale. Besides, when the modeled series for each individual
  month are merged to construct an October-to-March monthly series, and after
  removing the annual cycle in order to account for monthly anomalies, these
  correlate 0.65 (0.55) with the original SP (WP) series in average. These
  values remain fairly stable when the calibration and reconstruction periods
  differ, thus supporting up to a point the predictive potential of the method
  at the time-scale assessed here.%

  Ten-year (1964–1973) continuous records at Hamburg of hourly sums of solar
  and terrestrial, downward and upward radiation flux densities have been
  evaluated with regard to simultaneous hourly cloud observations. The
  irradiance at given solar elevation is plotted vs total cloud amount for each
  season and for the whole year; in the same way, the ratio of the irradiance
  under clouded to that under cloudless sky is presented. Additional diagrams
  show the irradiance under cloudless and under overcast sky as function of
  solar elevation. The ratio of global radiation at total cloud amount N okta,
  G(N), to global radiation at cloudless sky, G(0), at the same solar elevation
  $\gamma$ turned out to be indepenent of $\gamma$ and can be parameterized by
  G(N)G(0) = 1 − 0.75(N8)3.4. The influence of cloud type is demonstrated by
  diagrams showing the irradiance under skies overcast by a specific cloud type
  as function of solar elevation for each season and for the year; also, the
  corresponding ratios “overcast” to “cloudless” are presented. In the
  case of global radiation, the ratios G(8)G(0) which may be interpreted as the
  transmittances of the specific cloud types for global radiation, turned out
  to be independent of solar elevation and have the following mean values: Ci,
  Cc, Cs 0.61; Ac, As 0.27; Sc, Cu 0.25; St 0.18; Ns 0.16.%

  The Earth?s radiation budget is essential for driving the general circulation
  of the atmosphere and ocean, and for building the main conditions for the
  Earth's climate system. To detect changes in the Earth?s surface radiation
  field the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and its central archive -
  the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) - was created in 1992. BSRN is a
  project of the Radiation Panel (now the Data and Assessment Panel) from the
  Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) under the umbrella of the
  World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). It is the global baseline network
  for surface radiation for the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS),
  contributing to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW), and forming a cooperative
  network with the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change
  (NDACC). The data are of primary importance in supporting the validation and
  confirmation of satellite and computer model estimates. At a relatively small
  number of stations (currently 58) in contrasting climatic zones, solar and
  atmospheric radiation is measured with instruments of the highest available
  accuracy and with high temporal resolution (mainly 1 minute). A total of
  about 7000 station-month datasets were available in the WRMC in mid 2013. All
  data are interactively accessible to external users for bona fide research
  purposes at no cost. This report provides information for scientists
  interested in high quality surface radiation data as well as for scientists
  running a BSRN station. It offers information about the available data, the
  data access and describes tools to visualize the data and to check their
  quality.%

  Solar Energy Forecasting and Resource Assessment is a vital text for solar
  energy professionals, addressing a critical gap in the core literature of the
  field. As major barriers to solar energy implementation, such as materials
  cost and low conversion efficiency, continue to fall, issues of intermittency
  and reliability have come to the fore. Scrutiny from solar project developers
  and their financiers on the accuracy of long-term resource projections and
  grid operators?? concerns about variable short-term power generation have
  made the field of solar forecasting and resource assessment pivotally
  important. This volume provides an authoritative voice on the topic,
  incorporating contributions from an internationally recognized group of top
  authors from both industry and academia, focused on providing information

  We use the global atmospheric GCM aerosol model ECHAM5-HAM to asses possible
  impacts of future air pollution mitigation strategies on climate. Air quality
  control strategies focus on the reduction of aerosol emissions. Here we
  investigate the extreme case of a maximum feasible end-of-pipe abatement of
  aerosols in the near term future (2030) in combination with increasing
  greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. The temperature response of increasing
  GHG concentrations and reduced aerosol emissions leads to a global annual
  mean equilibrium temperature response of 2.18 K. When aerosols are maximally
  abated only in the Industry and Powerplant sector, while other sectors stay
  with currently enforced regulations, the temperature response is 1.89 K. A
  maximum feasible abatement applied in the Domestic and Transport sector,
  while other sectors remain with the current legislation, leads to a
  temperature response of 1.39 K. Increasing GHG concentrations alone lead to a
  temperature response of 1.20 K. We also simulate 2--5{\%} increases in global
  mean precipitation among all scenarios considered, and the hydrological
  sensitivity is found to be significantly higher for aerosols than for GHGs.
  Our study, thus highlights the huge potential impact of future air pollution
  mitigation strategies on climate and supports the need for urgent GHG
  emission reductions. GHG and aerosol forcings are not independent as both
  affect and are influenced by changes in the hydrological cycle. However,
  within the given range of changes in aerosol emissions and GHG concentrations
  considered in this study, the climate response towards increasing GHG
  concentrations and decreasing aerosols emissions is additive.%

  Although now over 100 years old, the classification$\backslash$nof climate

  Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) in systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE)
  is caused by autoantibodies directed against the circulating von Willebrand
  factor (vWF)/factor VIII (FVIII) complex. The autoantibody-vWF/FVIII antigen
  complex is cleared rapidly from the circulation, leading to a moderate to
  severe quantitative and qualitative deficiency of both vWF and FVIIIc.
  Consequently, AvWS in SLE is featured by a prolonged bleeding time and normal
  platelet count, a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and
  normal prothrombin time (PT), decreased or absent ristocetin-induced platelet
  aggregation (RIPA), and type II vWF deficiency on multimeric analysis of the
  vWF protein. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome type II in SLE responds poorly
  to 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) and FVIII concentrate, but
  responds transiently well to high-dose gammaglobulin given intravenously. All
  reported cases of AvWS in SLE were cured by appropriate treatment of the
  underlying autoimmune disease with prednisone or immunosuppression.%

  Anthropogenic aerosols are intricately linked to the climate system and to
  the hydrologic cycle. The net effect of aerosols is to cool the climate
  system by reflecting sunlight. Depending on their composition, aerosols can
  also absorb sunlight in the atmosphere, further cooling the surface but
  warming the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on the
  temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation
  nuclei, impact the hydrologic cycle, through changes in cloud cover, cloud
  properties and precipitation. Unravelling these feedbacks is particularly
  difficult because aerosols take a multitude of shapes and forms, ranging from
  desert dust to urban pollution, and because aerosol concentrations vary
  strongly over time and space. To accurately study aerosol distribution and
  composition therefore requires continuous observations from satellites,
  networks of ground-based instruments and dedicated field experiments.
  Increases in aerosol concentration and changes in their composition, driven
  by industrialization and an expanding population, may adversely affect the
  Earth's climate and water supply.%

  Based upon the data now available, this paper presents relationships
  permitting the determination on a horizontal surface of the instantaneous
  intensity of diffuse radiation on clear days, the long term average hourly
  and daily sums of diffuse radiation, and the daily sums of diffuse radiation
  for various categories of days of differing degrees of cloudiness. For these
  determinations, it is necessary to have, either from actual measurements or
  estimates, a knowledge of the total (direct plus diffuse) radiation on a
  horizontal surface-its measurement is now regularly made at 98 localities in
  the United States and Canada. For localities where only an estimate of the
  long term average total radiation is available, relationships presented in
  this paper can be utilized to determine the statistical distribution of the
  daily total radiation at these localities.%

  The contribution of power production from PV systems to the electricity
  supply is constantly increasing. An efficient use of the fluctuating solar
  power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the
  expected power production, as a basis for management of the electricity grids
  and trading on the energy market. We present and evaluate the regional PV
  power prediction system of University of Oldenburg and Meteocontrol GmbH
  providing forecasts of up to 2 days ahead with hourly resolution. The
  proposed approach is based on forecasts of the global model of the European
  Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF). It includes a post-processing
  procedure to derive optimised, site-specific irradiance forecasts and
  explicit physical modelling steps to convert the predicted irradiances to PV
  power. Finally, regional power forecasts are derived by up-scaling from a
  representative set of PV systems. The investigation of proper up-scaling is a
  special focus of this paper. We introduce a modified up-scaling approach,
  modelling the spatial distribution of the nominal power with a resolution of
  18?18. The operational PV power prediction system is evaluated in comparison
  to the modified up-scaling approach for the control areas of the two German
  transmission system operators ‘transpower' and ‘50 Hertz' for the period
  2.7.2009–30.4.2010. rmse values of the operational forecasts are in the
  range of 4–5{\%} with respect to the nominal power for intra-day and
  day-ahead forecast horizons. Further improvement is achieved with the
  modified up- scaling approach. Copyright {\#} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons,

  The paper reviews different approaches, technologies, and strategies to
  manage large-scale schemes of variable renewable electricity such as solar
  and wind power. We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition
  to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to
  renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range
  from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more
  advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked
  approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity,
  but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new
  solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may
  restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different "P2Y"-type of
  strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy
  form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal
  energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential
  flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To
  "functionalize" or to assess the value of the various energy system
  flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy
  market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing
  large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be
  promising.%

  Abstract. The Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment (ChArMEx;
  http://charmex.lsce.ipsl.fr) is a collaborative research program federating
  international activities to investigate Mediterranean regional
  chemistry-climate interactions. A special observing period (SOP-1a) including
  intensive airborne measurements was performed in the framework of the Aerosol
  Direct Radiative Impact on the regional climate in the MEDiterranean region
  (ADRIMED) project during the Mediterranean dry season over the western and
  central Mediterranean basins, with a focus on aerosol-radiation measurements
  and their modeling. The SOP-1a took place from 11 June to 5 July 2013.
  Airborne measurements were made by both the ATR-42 and F-20 French research
  aircraft operated from Sardinia (Italy) and instrumented for in situ and
  remote-sensing measurements, respectively, and by sounding and drifting
  balloons, launched in Minorca. The experimental setup also involved several
  ground-based measurement sites on islands including two ground-based
  reference stations in Corsica and Lampedusa and secondary monitoring sites in
  Minorca and Sicily. Additional measurements including lidar profiling were
  also performed on alert during aircraft operations at EARLINET/ACTRIS
  stations at Granada and Barcelona in Spain, and in southern Italy.
  Remote-sensing aerosol products from satellites (MSG/SEVIRI, MODIS) and from
  the AERONET/PHOTONS network were also used. Dedicated meso-scale and regional
  modeling experiments were performed in relation to this observational effort.
  We provide here an overview of the different surface and aircraft
  observations deployed during the ChArMEx/ADRIMED period and of associated
  modeling studies together with an analysis of the synoptic conditions that
  determined the aerosol emission and transport. Meteorological conditions
  observed during this campaign (moderate temperatures and southern flows) were
  not favorable to producing high levels of atmospheric pollutants or intense
  biomass burning events in the region. However, numerous mineral dust plumes
  were observed during the campaign, with the main sources located in Morocco,
  Algeria and Tunisia, leading to aerosol optical depth (AOD) values ranging
  between 0.2 and 0.6 (at 440nm) over the western and central Mediterranean
  basins. One important point of this experiment concerns the direct
  observations of aerosol extinction onboard the ATR-42, using the CAPS system,
  showing local maxima reaching up to 150M m−1 within the dust plume.
  Non-negligible aerosol extinction (about 50M m−1) has also been observed
  within the marine boundary layer (MBL). By combining the ATR-42 extinction
  coefficient observations with absorption and scattering measurements, we
  performed a complete optical closure revealing excellent agreement with
  estimated optical properties. This additional information on extinction
  properties has allowed calculation of the dust single scattering albedo (SSA)
  with a high level of confidence over the western Mediterranean. Our results
  show a moderate variability from 0.90 to 1.00 (at 530nm) for all flights
  studied compared to that reported in the literature on this optical
  parameter. Our results underline also a relatively low difference in SSA with
  values derived near dust sources. In parallel, active remote-sensing
  observations from the surface and onboard the F-20 aircraft suggest a complex
  vertical structure of particles and distinct aerosol layers with sea spray
  and pollution located within the MBL, and mineral dust and/or aged North
  American smoke particles located above (up to 6–7km in altitude). Aircraft
  and balloon-borne observations allow one to investigate the vertical
  structure of the aerosol size distribution showing particles characterized by
  a large size ({\textgreater} 10µm in diameter) within dust plumes. In most
  of cases, a coarse mode characterized by an effective diameter ranging
  between 5 and 10µm, has been detected above the MBL. In terms of shortwave
  (SW) direct forcing, in situ surface and aircraft observations have been
  merged and used as inputs in 1-D radiative transfer codes for calculating the
  aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF). Results show significant surface SW
  instantaneous forcing (up to −90W m−2 at noon). Aircraft observations
  provide also original estimates of the vertical structure of SW and LW
  radiative heating revealing significant instantaneous values of about 5°K
  per day in the solar spectrum (for a solar angle of 30°) within the dust
  layer. Associated 3-D modeling studies from regional climate (RCM) and
  chemistry transport (CTM) models indicate a relatively good agreement for
  simulated AOD compared with observations from the AERONET/PHOTONS network and
  satellite data, especially for long-range dust transport. Calculations of the
  3-D SW (clear-sky) surface DRF indicate an average of about −10 to −20W
  m−2 (for the whole period) over the Mediterranean Sea together with maxima
  (−50W m−2) over northern Africa. The top of the atmosphere (TOA) DRF is
  shown to be highly variable within the domain, due to moderate absorbing
  properties of dust and changes in the surface albedo. Indeed, 3-D simulations
  indicate negative forcing over the Mediterranean Sea and Europe and positive
  forcing over northern Africa. Finally, a multi-year simulation, performed for
  the 2003 to 2009 period and including an ocean–atmosphere (O–A) coupling,
  underlines the impact of the aerosol direct radiative forcing on the sea
  surface temperature, O–A fluxes and the hydrological cycle over the
  Mediterranean.%

  A power conversion efficiency record of 10.1{\%} was achieved for kesterite
  absorbers, using a Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)4 thin-film solar cell made by
  hydrazine-based solution processing. Key device characteristics were
  compiled, including light/dark J–V, quantum efficiency, temperature
  dependence of Voc and series resistance, photoluminescence, and capacitance
  spectroscopy, providing important insight into how the devices compare with
  high-performance Cu(In,Ga)Se2. The record kesterite device was shown to be
  primarily limited by interface recombination, minority carrier lifetime, and
  series resistance. The new level of device performance points to the
  significant promise of the kesterites as an emerging and commercially
  interesting thin-film technology. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley

  The contribution of clouds and aerosols to the decadal variations of downward
  surface shortwave radiation (SSR) is a current controversial topic. This
  study proposes a method, which is based on surface-based SSR measurements,
  aerosol observations, and radiative transfer simulations (in cloud-free and
  cloud- and aerosol-free scenarios), to evaluate cloud-aerosol (CARE), cloud
  (CRE), and aerosol (ARE) radiative effects. This method is applied to
  quantify the role played by, separately, clouds and aerosols on the intense
  brightening of the SSR observed in the Iberian Peninsula. Clouds and Earth's
  Radiation Energy Budget System (CERES) and surface-based data exhibit an
  increase in SSR between 2003 and 2012, exceeding +10 Wm-2 over this period
  for some areas of the peninsula. The calculations are performed for three
  surface-based sites: Barcelona and Valladolid (Spain), and {\'{E}}vora
  (Portugal). Ranges in monthly values of CARE, CRE, and ARE are (-80, -20),
  (-60, -20), and (-30,0), respectively (in W m-2). The average trends for the
  analyzed period of CARE, CRE, and ARE are +7, +5, and +2 Wm-2 per decade,
  respectively. Overall, three fourths of the SSR trend is explained by clouds,
  while the other one fourth is related to aerosol changes. The SSR trends
  explained by the clouds and aerosol radiative effects are in line with the
  observed reductions in total cloud cover and aerosol load (both at the
  surface and in the whole atmospheric column). Furthermore, the CRE values are
  compared against CERES data showing good agreement between both data series,
  although some discrepancies are observed in their trends.%

  Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming useful as alternate
  approaches to conventional techniques or as components of integrated systems.
  They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas
  and are becoming more popular nowadays. They can learn from examples, are
  fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete
  data, are able to deal with nonlinear problems and once trained can perform
  prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being
  developed and deployed worldwide in a wide variety of applications, mainly
  because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation
  capabilities. AI has been used in different sectors, such as engineering,
  economics, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for
  modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting and control
  of complex systems. The paper outlines an understanding of how AI systems
  operate by way of presenting a number of problems in photovoltaic systems
  application. Problems presented include three areas: forecasting and modeling
  of meteorological data, sizing of photovoltaic systems and modeling,
  simulation and control of photovoltaic systems. Published literature
  presented in this paper show the potential of AI as design tool in
  photovoltaic systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  This work describes a new hybrid method that combines information from
  processed satellite images with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for
  predicting global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at temporal horizons of 30, 60,
  90, and 120min. The forecast model is applied to GHI data gathered from two
  distinct locations (Davis and Merced) that represent well the geographical
  distribution of solar irradiance in the San Joaquin Valley. The forecasting
  approach uses information gathered from satellite image analysis including
  velocimetry and cloud indexing as inputs to the ANN models. To the knowledge
  of the authors, this is the first attempt to hybridize stochastic learning
  and image processing approaches for solar irradiance forecasting. We compare
  the hybrid approaches using standard error metrics to quantify the
  forecasting skill for the several time horizons considered.%

  Photovoltaic (PV) modules in real operation present angular losses in
  reference to their behaviour in standard test conditions, due to the angle of
  incidence of the incident radiation and the surface soil. Although these
  losses are not always negligible, they are commonly not taken into account
  when correcting the electrical characteristics of the PV module or estimating
  the energy production of PV systems. The main reason of this approximation is
  the lack of easy-to-use mathematical expressions for the angular losses
  calculation. This paper analyses these losses on PV modules and presents an
  analytical model based on theoretical and experimental results. The proposed
  model fits monocrystalline as well as polycrystalline and amorphous silicon
  PV modules, and contemplates the existence of superficial dust. With it
  angular losses integrated over time periods of interest can be easily
  calculated. Monthly and annual losses have been calculated for 10 different
  European sites, having diverse climates and latitudes (ranging from 32?? to
  52??), and considering different module tilt angles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science

  The environmental and economical merits of converting solar energy into
  electricity via photovoltaic cells have caused an ever increasing interest
  among developed and developing countries to allocate more budget on
  photovoltaic systems in order to boost up their efficiency in recent years.
  Besides the material and design parameters, there are several omnipresent
  factors such as dust, humidity and air velocity that can influence the PV
  cell's performance. There have been a handful of studies conducted on the
  effect of various influential parameters on the efficiency and performance of
  photovoltaic cells; however none has taken all these three parameters into
  account simultaneously. In this study the impact of dust accumulation,
  humidity level and the air velocity will be elaborated separately and finally
  the impact of each on the other will be clarified. It is shown that each of
  these three factors affect the other two and it is concluded that in order to
  have a profound insight of solar cell design, the effect of these factors
  should be taken into consideration in parallel. {\textcopyright} 2012

  Abstract. Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to
  retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In
  parallel, AOD climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations
  are now also available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several
  aerosol types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative
  analysis of this unique multi-year database in terms of total AOD and of its
  apportionment by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, sea-salt, sulfate,
  black and organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD
  products: NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS,
  AQUA/MODIS, ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more
  historical datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth-Probe) and
  METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from
  Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4,
  the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS
  and MACC. Ground-based Level-2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations
  around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The
  sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this
  region, showing a relevant spatio-temporal variability and highlighting high
  dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate
  aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows
  limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard
  products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the
  basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to
  underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to
  MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical
  dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study
  confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a
  large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are
  confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D
  blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time
  series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the
  Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the 2003–2009 period.
  The product is based on the total AOD from AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into
  sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC reanalysis, and into dust
  and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations, which are distributed
  vertically based on CALIOP climatology. We extend the 2003–2009
  reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the 2003–2009 average and
  applying the decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose
  AOD trends over Europe and the Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP
  models. Finally optical properties of the different aerosol types in this
  region are proposed from Mie calculations so that this reconstruction can be
  included in regional climate models for aerosol radiative forcing and
  aerosol-climate studies.%

  Since the 1980s anthropogenic aerosols have been considerably reduced in
  Europe and the Mediterranean area. This decrease is often considered as the
  likely cause of the brightening effect observed over the same period. This
  phenomenon is however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate
  models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled
  regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain 81 ±
  16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the surface warming
  simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct aerosol effect
  is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated brightening. The
  comparison between regional simulations and homogenized ground-based
  observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as well as land
  and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the
  Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the
  realistic aerosol variations.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A fully coupled regional climate system model (CNRM-RCSM4) has been used over
  the Mediterranean region to investigate the direct and semi-direct effects of
  aerosols, but also their role in the radiation--atmosphere--ocean
  interactions through multi-annual ensemble simulations (2003--2009) with and
  without aerosols and ocean--atmosphere coupling. Aerosols have been taken
  into account in CNRM-RCSM4 through realistic interannual monthly AOD
  climatologies. An evaluation of the model has been achieved, against various
  observations for meteorological parameters, and has shown the ability of
  CNRM-RCSM4 to reproduce the main patterns of the Mediterranean climate
  despite some biases in sea surface temperature (SST), radiation and cloud
  cover. The results concerning the aerosol radiative effects show a negative
  surface forcing on average because of the absorption and scattering of the
  incident radiation. The SW surface direct effect is on average −20.9 Wm−2
  over the Mediterranean Sea, −14.7 Wm−2 over Europe and −19.7 Wm−2
  over northern Africa. The LW surface direct effect is weaker as only dust
  aerosols contribute (+4.8 Wm−2 over northern Africa). This direct effect is
  partly counterbalanced by a positive semi-direct radiative effect over the
  Mediterranean Sea (+5.7 Wm−2 on average) and Europe (+5.0 Wm−2) due to
  changes in cloud cover and atmospheric circulation. The total aerosol effect
  is consequently negative at the surface and responsible for a decrease in
  land (on average −0.4 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C over Europe, and
  −0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C over northern Africa) and sea surface
  temperature (on average −0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C for the
  Mediterranean SST). In addition, the latent heat loss is shown to be weaker
  (−11.0 Wm−2) in the presence of aerosols, resulting in a decrease in
  specific humidity in the lower troposphere, and a reduction in cloud cover
  and precipitation. Simulations also indicate that dust aerosols warm the
  troposphere by absorbing solar radiation, and prevent radiation from reaching
  the surface, thus stabilizing the troposphere. The comparison with the model
  response in atmosphere-only simulations shows that these feedbacks are
  attenuated if SST cannot be modified by aerosols, highlighting the importance
  of using coupled regional models over the Mediterranean. Oceanic convection
  is also strengthened by aerosols, which tends to reinforce the Mediterranean
  thermohaline circulation. In parallel, two case studies are presented to
  illustrate positive feedbacks between dust aerosols and regional climate.
  First, the eastern Mediterranean was subject to high dust aerosol loads in
  June 2007 which reduce land and sea surface temperature, as well as air--sea
  humidity fluxes. Because of northern wind over the eastern Mediterranean,
  drier and cooler air has been consequently advected from the sea to the
  African continent, reinforcing the direct dust effect over land. On the
  contrary, during the western European heat wave in June 2006, dust aerosols
  have contributed to reinforcing an important ridge responsible for dry and
  warm air advection over western Europe, and thus to increasing lower
  troposphere (+0.8 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C) and surface temperature
  (+0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C), namely about 15 {\{}{\%}{\}} of this
  heat wave.%

  Photovoltaic (PV) energy is one option to serve the rising global energy need
  with low environmental impact. PV is of particular interest for local energy
  solutions in developing countries prone to high solar insolation. In order to
  assess the PV potential of prospective sites, combining knowledge of the
  atmospheric state modulating solar radiation and the PV performance is
  necessary. The present study discusses the PV power as function of
  atmospheric aerosols in the Sahel zone for clear-sky-days. Daily yields for a

  We examine multidecadal changes in surface downward shortwave (SW) radiation
  flux, total cloud cover, SW cloud effect, and related parameters over Europe
  during 1965{\&}{\#}8211;2004 using monthly gridded data from the Global
  Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), synoptic cloud reports, and the International
  Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). One key issue is distinguishing
  the effects of natural cloud variability from long-term anthropogenic aerosol
  influences on surface SW flux. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of cloud
  cover radiative effect (CCRE), defined as the change in downward SW flux
  produced by a change in cloud cover. The correlation between pan-European
  time series of CCRE anomalies and GEBA solar radiation anomalies is 0.88,
  indicating that cloud cover variability and associated changes in cloud
  albedo dominate SW radiation variability on monthly to decadal timescales.
  After these weather-related cloud effects are removed by subtracting CCRE
  anomalies from GEBA solar radiation anomalies via linear regression, a
  distinct decreasing trend followed by a distinct increasing trend remain in
  the residual time series. Depending on the method of trend calculation,
  pan-European residual flux declined by a statistically significant
  2.7{\&}{\#}8211;3.5 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2 per decade during 1971{\&}{\#}8211;1986
  and rose by a statistically significant 2.0{\&}{\#}8211;2.3 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2
  per decade during 1987{\&}{\#}8211;2002. The fact that independent grid boxes
  exhibit mostly negative trends in the earlier period and mostly positive
  trends in the later period demonstrates that these long-term variations in SW
  flux are real and widespread over Europe. Changes in cloud cover cannot
  account for the trends in surface SW flux since cloud cover actually slightly
  decreased during 1971{\&}{\#}8211;1986 and slightly increased during
  1987{\&}{\#}8211;2002. The most likely explanation is changes in
  anthropogenic aerosol emissions that led to more scattering and absorption of
  SW radiation during the earlier period of solar
  {\&}{\#}8220;dimming{\&}{\#}8221; and less scattering and absorption during
  the later period of solar {\&}{\#}8220;brightening.{\&}{\#}8221;%

  To support climate research, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)
  initiated a new radiometric network, the Baseline Surface Radiation Network
  (BSRN). The network aims at providing validation material for satellite
  radiometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term
  variations in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play
  an important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are
  designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required
  to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long
  period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these
  goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and
  the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all
  stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics
  (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored
  at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center
  (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at
  stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be
  stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred
  to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN,
  consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S,
  and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to
  scientific communities in various ways depending on the communication
  environment of the users. The present article discusses the scientific base,
  organizational and technical aspects of the network, and data retrieval
  methods; shows various application possibilities; and presents the future
  tasks to be accomplished.%

  Ideally, one needs long-term time series of solar-radiation data and
  temperature data for each specific site at the hourly level. Such data are
  relatively rare, so in recent years statistical approaches have been
  developed to help fill the gap. Long series of daily data are needed for
  sizing and modeling of stand-alone systems. Effective statistical approaches
  have to recognize the links between solar-radiation data and temperature
  data. Solar-radiation data are often presented in a dimensionless form called
  the clearness index. The experience gained in the production of European
  Solar Radiation Atlas 2000 has indicated the great importance of having daily
  time series of global radiation for making sensibly reliable design
  decisions. Otherwise, the day-to-day variability patterns in solar radiation
  due to weather change will be lost. The daily global radiation can be
  profiled to match the clear-day profile to estimate hourly irradiation values
  with an acceptable loss in accuracy. The monthly mean values cannot be used
  with accuracy to simulate daily profiles.%

  Solar power is the third major renewable energy, constituting an increasingly
  important component of global future—low carbon—energy portfolio.
  Accurate climate information is essential for the conditions of solar energy
  production, maximization, and stable regulation and planning. Climate change
  impacts on energy output projections are thus of crucial importance. In this
  study the effect of projected changes in irradiance and temperature on the
  performance of photovoltaic systems in Greece is examined. Climate
  projections were obtained from 5 regional climate models (RCMs) under the A1B
  emissions scenario, for two future periods. The RCM data present systematic
  errors against observed values, resulting in the need of bias adjustment. The
  projected change in photovoltaic energy output was then estimated,
  considering changes in temperature and insolation. The spatiotemporal
  analysis indicates significant increase in mean annual temperature (up to
  3.5°C) and mean total radiation (up to 5 W/m 2 ) by 2100. The performance of
  photovoltaic systems exhibits a negative linear dependence on the projected
  temperature increase which is outweighed by the expected increase of total
  radiation resulting in an up to 4{\%} increase in energy output.%

  This paper presents a validation of the short and medium term global
  irradiance forecasts that are produced as part of the US SolarAnywhere (2010)
  data set. The short term forecasts that extend up to 6-h ahead are based upon
  cloud motion derived from consecutive geostationary satellite images. The
  medium term forecasts extend up to 6-days-ahead and are modeled from gridded
  cloud cover forecasts from the US National Digital Forecast Database. The
  forecast algorithms are validated against ground measurements for seven
  climatically distinct locations in the United States for 1year. An initial
  analysis of regional performance using satellite-derived irradiances as a
  benchmark reference is also presented.%

  The energy produced by a photovoltaic system over a given period can be
  estimated from the incident radiation at the site where the Grid Connected PV
  System (GCPVS) is located, assuming knowledge of certain basic features of
  the system under study. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of solar
  radiation, the question "How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this
  location over the next few years?" involves an exercise of prediction
  inevitably subjected to a degree of uncertainty. Moreover, during the life
  cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: "Is the system working
  correctly?". This paper proposes and examines several methods to cope with
  these questions. The daily performance of a PV system is simulated. This
  simulation and the interannual variability of both radiation and productivity
  are statistically analyzed. From the results several regression adjustments
  are obtained. This analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity
  prediction and performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical
  analysis of the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method
  of malfunctioning parts of the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract. Solar radiation is the main driver of the Earth's climate.
  Measuring solar radiation and analysing its interaction with clouds are
  essential for the understanding of the climate system. The EUMETSAT Satellite
  Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) generates
  satellite-based, high-quality climate data records, with a focus on the
  energy balance and water cycle. Here, multiple of these data records are
  analyzed in a common framework to assess the consistency in trends and
  spatio-temporal variability of surface solar radiation, top-of-atmosphere
  reflected solar radiation and cloud fraction. This multi-parameter analysis
  focuses on Europe and covers the time period from 1992 to 2015. A high
  correlation between these three variables has been found over Europe. An
  overall consistency of the climate data records reveals an increase of
  surface solar radiation and a decrease in top-of-atmosphere reflected
  radiation. In addition, those trends are confirmed by negative trends in
  cloud cover. This consistency documents the high quality and stability of the
  CM SAF climate data records, which are mostly derived independently from each
  other. The results of this study indicate that one of the main reasons for
  the positive trend in surface solar radiation since the 1990's is a decrease
  in cloud coverage even if an aerosol contribution cannot be completely ruled
  out.%

  Abstract The incoming solar radiation is the essential climate variable that
  determines the Earth's energy cycle and climate. As long-term high-quality
  surface measurements of solar radiation are rare, satellite data are used to
  derive more information on its spatial pattern and its temporal variability.
  Recently, the EUMETSAT Satellite Application on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF)
  has published two satellite-based climate data records: Surface Solar
  Radiation Data Set-Heliosat, Edition 2 (SARAH-2), and Clouds and Radiation
  Data Set based on AVHRR (advanced very high resolution radiometer) Satellite
  Measurements, Edition 2 (CLARA-A2). Both data records provide estimates of
  surface solar radiation. In this study, these new climate data records are
  compared to surface measurements in Europe during the period 1983–2015.
  SARAH-2 and CLARA-A2 show a high accuracy compared to ground-based
  observations (mean absolute deviations of 6.9 and 7.3 W/m2, respectively)
  highlighting a good agreement considering the temporal behavior and the
  spatial distribution. The results show an overall brightening period since
  the 1980s onward (comprised between 1.9 and 2.4 W/m2/decade), with
  substantial decadal and spatial variability. The strongest brightening is
  found in eastern Europe in spring. An exception is found for northern and
  southern Europe, where the trends shown by the station data are not
  completely reproduced by satellite data, especially in summer in southern
  Europe. We conclude that the major part of the observed trends in surface
  solar radiation in Europe is caused by changes in clouds and that remaining
  differences between the satellite- and the station-based data might be
  connected to changes in the direct aerosol effect and in snow cover.%

  The irradiance fluctuations and the subsequent variability of the power
  output of a PV system are analysed with some mathematical tools based on the
  wavelet transform. It can be shown that the irradiance and power time series
  are nonstationary process whose behaviour resembles that of a long memory
  process. Besides, the long memory spectral exponent $\alpha$ is a useful
  indicator of the fluctuation level of a irradiance time series. On the other
  side, a time series of global irradiance on the horizontal plane can be
  simulated by means of the wavestrapping technique on the clearness index and
  the fluctuation behaviour of this simulated time series correctly resembles
  the original series. Moreover, a time series of global irradiance on the
  inclined plane can be simulated with the wavestrapping procedure applied over
  a signal previously detrended by a partial reconstruction with a wavelet
  multiresolution analysis, and, once again, the fluctuation behaviour of this
  simulated time series is correct. This procedure is a suitable tool for the
  simulation of irradiance incident over a group of distant PV plants. Finally,
  a wavelet variance analysis and the long memory spectral exponent show that a
  PV plant behaves as a low-pass filter.%

  This paper analyzes the correlation between the fluctuations of the
  electrical power generated by the ensemble of 70DC/AC inverters from a 45.6MW
  PV plant. The use of real electrical power time series from a large
  collection of photovoltaic inverters of a same plant is an important
  contribution in the context of models built upon simplified assumptions to
  overcome the absence of such data. This data set is divided into three
  different fluctuation categories with a clustering procedure which performs
  correctly with the clearness index and the wavelet variances. Afterwards, the
  time dependent correlation between the electrical power time series of the
  inverters is estimated with the wavelet transform. The wavelet correlation
  depends on the distance between the inverters, the wavelet time scales and
  the daily fluctuation level. Correlation values for time scales below one
  minute are low without dependence on the daily fluctuation level. For time
  scales above 20min, positive high correlation values are obtained, and the
  decay rate with the distance depends on the daily fluctuation level. At
  intermediate time scales the correlation depends strongly on the daily
  fluctuation level. The proposed methods have been implemented using free
  software. Source code is available as supplementary material.%

  This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of satellite-based methods for
  deriving solar irradiance components for analyzing the impact of the external
  inputs that are normally associated to the satellite model. Different
  sensitivity calculations have been performed using as reference site the PSA
  (Solar Platform of Almeria) station placed at the south-east of Spain. Thus,
  the sensitivity to the aerosol information input has been addressed by
  comparing the estimations using aerosol input from AERONET data with those
  using aerosol dataset such as MODIS or MISR (based on satellite) and MACC
  (based on reanalysis). Sensitivity to the clear sky model choice has been
  also studied by using three different models, from the simpler ESRA model (in
  terms of input parameters) to the most sophisticated REST2. Finally, three
  global to direct conversion models (Louche, DirInt and DirIndex) have been
  included to explore the sensitivity of the direct normal irradiance
  estimations. The sensitivity analysis has shown the interrelations between
  the different cases according to the uncertainty of the input information
  used. The results have been analyzed for clear and non-clear sky conditions
  separately and for the DNI irradiance range of 400–900 W m−2 as a case of
  special interest for the concentrating solar power applications. The work
  presented here has as novelty the analysis of the propagation of uncertainty
  of individual models and atmospheric datasets in the framework of a
  satellite-based model for solar irradiance computation and their relative
  weights to the final performance of the model. An underestimation of AOD by
  50{\%} causes an error in the global horizontal irradiance calculated by a
  clear sky model of 3–5{\%} depending on the model used, and slightly less
  for an overestimation of AOD. For DNI the error ranges are 12–15{\%} and
  9–12{\%} for 50{\%} underestimation and overestimation of AOD
  respectively.%

  A study on the spatial variability of long term solar radiation in Vietnam
  and the results of clustering solar radiation into different regions are
  presented here. Vietnam has a dense and long network of sunshine duration
  measurements, and on the contrary the country has a scarce availability of
  solar irradiance measuring sites. The variability of long term solar
  radiation can be analyzed by determining daily global irradiation from
  sunshine duration. A model inspired in Angstrom equation has been developed
  using the canonical correlation analysis with good performance. The output of
  the model has been used for characterizing the dispersion of long term solar
  radiation and its spatial distribution has been also studied by clustering
  techniques. The comparison with the K{\"{o}}ppen climatic information remarks
  that Vietnam could be divided into 3-4 well defined zones of different solar
  radiation variability.%

  Solar surface irradiance (SIS) and direct (SID) irradiance as well as
  effective cloud albedo (CAL) climate data records (CDR) derived from the
  Meteosat first generation satellites (Meteosats 2 to 7, 1983-2005) are
  presented. The CDRs are available free of charge for all purposes from
  wui.cmsaf.eu at monthly, daily and hourly means at a spatial resolution of
  0.03.The processing employed a climate version of the Heliosat algorithm
  combined with a clear sky model using an eigenvector look-up table method.
  Modifications to the Heliosat method include a self-calibration algorithm as
  well as a running mean based clear sky retrieval algorithm.The datasets are
  validated using ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation
  Network (BSRN) as a reference. The validation threshold for the mean absolute
  bias between satellite-derived and surface-measured radiation is given by the
  target accuracy for solar irradiance fields defined by the Global Climate
  Observing system (GCOS) and a measurement uncertainty for the surface data.
  The results demonstrate that the target accuracy is achieved for monthly and
  daily means. Furthermore, an intercomparison with similar datasets reveal a
  better performance and climate monitoring potential of the CM SAF SIS CDR at
  most BSRN sites compared to established data sets like e.g. ERA-reanalysis,
  GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International
  Satellite Cloud Climatology Project). Lastly, the realistic representation of
  both seasonal and inter-annual variability guarantees the applicability of
  the satellite-based climate data sets for climate monitoring and analysis of
  extremes.No trends in the normalized bias between the CM SAF and the BSRN
  datasets are detectable, which demonstrates the stability and homogeneity of
  the global and direct irradiance for the period covered by BSRN measurements.
  However, inconsistencies are detectable at few satellite transition dates for
  certain regions in earlier years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.%

  We explore the relationship between the NAO and the solar radiation
  spatio-temporal variability in the European North Atlantic area during
  winter. Measured monthly sums of sunshine duration and short-wave downward
  solar flux reanalysis data have been used. Correlation analysis between the
  NAO index and the measured sunshine duration shows a dipolar pattern, with
  maximum positive values (+0.75) over the Iberian Peninsula, and maximum
  negative values (−0.71) over Norway. Reanalysis results confirm these
  findings. Composite analysis shows, for northern Europe, negative anomalies
  (−10{\%} to −20{\%}) associated with NAO {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 1 and
  positive anomalies (10{\%} to 20{\%}) associated with NAO {\{}{\textless}{\}}
  −1; while for southern Europe anomalies are, respectively, 10{\%} to 20{\%}
  and −10{\%} to −20{\%}. A stronger influence is found during the NAO
  negative phase; particularly, the northern British Isles, Norway and the
  Iberian Peninsula present a significant non-linear response, with higher
  anomalies (10{\%} to 20{\%}) during this negative phase.%

  The increasing penetration of PV systems in the distribution network creates
  new opportunities but also raises several issues for the grid operation. New
  challenges, arising from the variable nature of solar energy generation, must
  be tackled in order to keep a stable and balanced power grid. In this study,
  short term variability in power output due to changing intensity due to cloud
  cover is assessed for its impact on energy delivery. Studies on this subject
  conclude that while there may be local variability, there is a strong
  reduction in that variability when the aggregate of several PV systems is
  taken into account, rather than just one PV system. The analysis shows that
  the aggregated effect of many geographically dispersed systems PV systems
  yields a smoothing effect that reduces the impact of local variability.%

  The importance for reliable forecasts of incoming solar radiation is growing
  rapidly, especially for those countries with an increasing share in
  photovoltaic (PV) power production. The reliability of solar radiation
  forecasts depends mainly on the representation of clouds and aerosol
  particles absorbing and scattering radiation. Especially under extreme
  aerosol conditions, numerical weather prediction has a systematic bias in the
  solar radiation forecast. This is caused by the design of numerical weather
  prediction models, which typically account for the direct impact of aerosol
  particles on radiation using climatological mean values and the impact on
  cloud formation assuming spatially and temporally homogeneous aerosol
  concentrations. These model deficiencies in turn can lead to significant
  economic losses under extreme aerosol conditions. For Germany, Saharan dust
  outbreaks occurring 5 to 15 times per year for several days each are
  prominent examples for conditions, under which numerical weather prediction
  struggles to forecast solar radiation adequately. We investigate the impact
  of mineral dust on the PV power generation during a Saharan dust outbreak
  over Germany at 4 April 2014 using ICON-ART, which is the current German
  numerical weather prediction model extended by modules accounting for trace
  substances and related feedback processes. We find an overall improvement of
  the PV power forecast for 65{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the pyranometer stations in
  Germany. Of the nine stations with very high differences between forecast and
  measurement, eight stations show an improvement. Furthermore, we quantify the
  direct radiative effects and indirect radiative effects of mineral dust. For
  our study, direct effects account for 64{\&}thinsp;{\%}, indirect effects for
  20{\&}thinsp;{\%} and synergistic interaction effects for 16{\&}thinsp;{\%}
  of the differences between the forecast including mineral dust radiative
  effects and the forecast neglecting mineral dust.%

  AbstractThe Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and
  vulnerable climate change “hotspots” of the twenty-first century, and the
  physical mechanisms underlying this finding are still not clear. Furthermore,
  complex interactions and feedbacks involving
  ocean–atmosphere–land–biogeochemical processes play a prominent role in
  modulating the climate and environment of the Mediterranean region on a range
  of spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is critical to provide robust
  climate change information for use in vulnerability–impact–adaptation
  assessment studies considering the Mediterranean as a fully coupled
  environmental system. The Mediterranean Coordinated Regional Downscaling
  Experiment (Med-CORDEX) initiative aims at coordinating the Mediterranean
  climate modeling community toward the development of fully coupled regional
  climate simulations, improving all relevant components of the system from
  atmosphere and ocean dynamics to land surface, hydrology, and biogeochemical
  processes. The primary goals of Med-CORDEX are to improve understanding of
  past climate variability and trends and to provide more accurate and reliable
  future projections, assessing in a quantitative and robust way the added
  value of using high-resolution and coupled regional climate models. The
  coordination activities and the scientific outcomes of Med-CORDEX can produce
  an important framework to foster the development of regional Earth system
  models in several key regions worldwide.%

  Electricity from wind and, to a lesser extent, solar energy is intermittent
  and not controllable. Unlike conventional power generation, therefore, this
  electricity is not suitable to supply base-load electric power. In the
  future, with greater penetration of these renewable sources, intermittency
  and control problems will become critical. Here, the authors explore the use
  of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for analyzing spatiotemporal
  balancing between regional solar and wind energy resources. The CCA allows
  optimal distribution of wind farms and solar energy plants across a territory
  to minimize the variability of total energy input into the power supply
  system. The method was tested in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula,
  a region covering about 350 000 km(2). The authors used daily-integrated wind
  and solar energy estimates in 2007 from the Weather Research and Forecasting
  (WRF) mesoscale model, at a spatial resolution of 9 km. Results showed
  valuable balancing patterns in the study region, but with a marked
  seasonality in strength, sign, and spatial coverage. The autumn season showed
  the most noteworthy results, with a balancing pattern extending almost over
  the entire study region. With location of reference wind farms and
  photovoltaic (PV) plants according to the balancing patterns, their combined
  power production shows substantially lower variability than production of the
  wind farms and PV plants separately and combined production obtained with any
  other locations. Atmospheric circulations associated with the balancing
  patterns were found to be significantly different between seasons. In this
  regard, synoptic-scale variability played an important role, but so did
  topographic conditions, especially near the Strait of Gibraltar.%

  This study analyzes the spatial and temporal changes in sunshine duration
  (SunDu) and total cloud cover (TCC) over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and four
  subregions during 1961–2004 using high-quality, homogenized data sets. The
  analyses confirm that over most of the IP and in most seasons, SunDu and TCC
  variations are strongly negatively correlated, with absolute values
  ∼0.8–0.9. Somewhat weaker correlations (0.5–0.6) are found in the
  southern portion of the IP in summer. A large discrepancy between the SunDu
  and TCC records occurs from the 1960s until the early 1980s when the SunDu
  series shows a decrease that it is not associated with an increase in TCC.
  This negative trend or “dimming” is even more pronounced after removing
  the effects of TCC via linear regression. Since the early 1980s, the SunDu
  and TCC residual SunDu series exhibit an upward trend or “brightening.”
  In addition to the long-term dimming and brightening, the volcanic eruptions
  of El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo are clearly evident in the TCC residual
  SunDu record. The TCC and SunDu records over the IP are well correlated with
  sea level pressure (SLP), with above normal TCC and below normal SunDu
  corresponding to below normal SLP locally in all seasons. The TCC and SunDu
  related SLP changes over the IP in winter and spring are part of a
  larger-scale north-south dipole pattern that extends over the entire
  Euro-Atlantic sector. Other more regional atmospheric circulation patterns,
  identified from rotated principal component analysis, are also linked to TCC
  and SunDu variations over the IP. Finally and perhaps surprisingly, the TCC
  residual SunDu series exhibits a statistically significant relationship with
  a regional atmospheric circulation pattern during spring, summer, and
  autumn.%

  Many clustering and segmentation algorithms both suffer from the limitation
  that the number of clusters/segments are specified by a human user. It is
  often impractical to expect a human with sufficient domain knowledge to be
  available to select the number of clusters/segments to return. In this paper,
  we investigate techniques to determine the number of clusters or segments to
  return from hierarchical clustering and segmentation algorithms. We propose
  an efficient algorithm, the L method, that finds the knee in a of clusters
  vs. clustering evaluation metric graph. Using the knee is well-known, but is
  not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of
  clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine
  in which situations it will and will not work. We also compare the L method
  to existing methods based on the accuracy of the number of clusters that are
  determined and efficiency. Our results show favorable performance for these
  criteria compared to the existing methods that were evaluated.%

  The operation of hydroelectric plants in Brazil depends on the hydrological
  regime, which is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations and faces
  critical levels of storage in certain periods. Hydropower accounts for 66{\%}
  of the countrys generation and poses a challenge for the stabilization of the
  grid in the mid and long terms. Usually, such fluctuations are complemented
  by conventional sources (thermo power). Studies have shown, however, that
  wind power can assist hydroelectric power generation. The water saved can be
  stored for energy generation and other purposes. This work addresses the
  possibility of complementing the hydro system with offshore wind power. To do
  so, monthly precipitation data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU-TS 3.1)
  [1] is compared with satellite winds from NOAA [2,3], to assess their
  variability on seasonal and interannual time scales. Results show high wind
  magnitudes in the North, Northeast, Southeast and Southern regions of Brazil.
  There is strong seasonal complementarity between the wind regimes of the
  Northeast and Northern regions. North and especially Northeast offshore winds
  were shown to be highly complementary with the hydrological regimes of
  S{\~{a}}o Francisco, Eastern Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, Paran{\'{a}},
  Paraguai, Uruguai and South Atlantic basins. In addition, the southern
  hydrographic basin variability was found uncorrelated with other hydrological
  basins and wind regions.%

  Trends of all-sky downward surface solar radiation (SSR) from
  satellite-derived data over Europe (1983–2010) are first presented. The
  results show a widespread (i.e., non-local dimension) increase in the major
  part of Europe, especially since the mid-1990s in the central and northern
  areas and in springtime. There is a mean increase of SSR of at least 2Wm−2
  per decade from 1983 to 2010 over the whole Europe, which, taking into
  account that the satellite-derived product lacks of aerosol variations, can
  be mostly related to a decrease in the cloud radiative effects over Europe.
  Secondly, residual series have been derived as the result of the difference
  between ground-based and satellite-derived all-sky SSR data. The residual
  mean series points to a significant increase during the period 1983–2010,
  with higher rates of around 2Wm−2 per decade over central and eastern
  Europe. The spatial variation of these residual time series, which are in
  line with clear-sky SSR trends over Europe reported in the literature, seem
  to suggest that these differences in the residual series are not just
  explained by calibration issues in the satellite-derived product.%

  Global average trends in solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface show a
  transition from dimming to brightening that occurred in about 1990. We show
  that the inter-annual trend in solar radiation between 1980 and 2000 mirrors
  the trend in primary emissions of SO2 and black carbon, which together
  contribute about one-third of global average aerosol optical depth. Combined
  global emissions of these two species peaked in 1988–1989. The two-decadal
  rate of decline in aerosol loading resulting from these emission changes,
  0.13{\%} yr−1, can be compared with the reported increase in solar
  radiation of 0.10{\%} yr−1 in 1983–2001. Regional patterns of aerosol and
  radiation changes are also qualitatively consistent. We conclude that changes
  in the aerosol burden due to changing patterns of anthropogenic emissions are
  likely contributing to the trends in surface solar radiation.%

  Abstract Global aerosol and ozone distributions and their associated
  radiative forcings were simulated between 1850 and 2100 following a recent
  historical emission dataset and under the representative concentration
  pathways (RCP) for the future. These simulations were used in an Earth System
  Model to account for the changes in both radiatively and chemically active
  compounds, when simulating the climate evolution. The past negative
  stratospheric ozone trends result in a negative climate forcing culminating
  at -0.15 W m-2 in the 1990s. In the meantime, the tropospheric ozone burden
  increase generates a positive climate forcing peaking at 0.41 W m-2. The
  future evolution of ozone strongly depends on the RCP scenario considered. In
  RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, the evolution of both stratospheric and tropospheric ozone
  generate relatively weak radiative forcing changes until 2060–2070 followed
  by a relative 30 {\%} decrease in radiative forcing by 2100. In contrast,
  RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 model projections exhibit strongly different ozone
  radiative forcing trajectories. In the RCP2.6 scenario, both effects
  (stratospheric ozone, a negative forcing, and tropospheric ozone, a positive
  forcing) decline towards 1950s values while they both get stronger in the
  RCP8.5 scenario. Over the twentieth century, the evolution of the total
  aerosol burden is characterized by a strong increase after World War II until
  the middle of the 1980s followed by a stabilization during the last decade
  due to the strong decrease in sulfates in OECD countries since the 1970s. The
  cooling effects reach their maximal values in 1980, with -0.34 and -0.28 W
  m-2 respectively for direct and indirect total radiative forcings. According
  to the RCP scenarios, the aerosol content, after peaking around 2010, is
  projected to decline strongly and monotonically during the twenty-first
  century for the RCP8.5, 4.5 and 2.6 scenarios. While for RCP6.0 the decline
  occurs later, after peaking around 2050. As a consequence the relative
  importance of the total cooling effect of aerosols becomes weaker throughout
  the twenty-first century compared with the positive forcing of greenhouse
  gases. Nevertheless, both surface ozone and aerosol content show very
  different regional features depending on the future scenario considered.
  Hence, in 2050, surface ozone changes vary between -12 and ?12 ppbv over Asia
  depending on the RCP projection, whereas the regional direct aerosol
  radiative forcing can locally exceed -3 W m-2.%

  We combine global distributions of aerosol loading resulting from transport

  aerosol distributions we estimate optical thicknesses and compare them with
  Sun photometer measurements and satellite retrievals: thereby revealing
  problems with both model results and comparisons with such measurements.
  Globally, sulfate, dust, and carbonaceous particles appear to contribute
  equally to the total aerosol optical thickness. Owing to the different
  optical properties of different aerosol types, aerosol composition should be
  taken into consideration for estimating the aerosol climate effect as well as
  for aerosol retrievals from satellite measurements.%

  Climate change may alter the geographical pattern and intensity of
  near-surface winds which are the "fuel" for wind turbines. In a context of
  fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating
  the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This
  study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power
  generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production
  from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020.
  For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an
  ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate
  Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission
  scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large
  multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the
  estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We
  show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most
  of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within ±15 and ±20
  {\%} by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward
  a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an
  increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will
  not exceed 5 and 15 {\%} in magnitude at the European and national scale
  respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned
  by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind
  energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects
  in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy
  mix plans.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]%

  The electricity sector is currently considered mainly on the emission side of
  the climate change equation. In order to limit climate warming to below 2
  °C, or even 1.5 °C, it must undergo a rapid transition towards carbon
  neutral production by the mid-century. Simultaneously, electricity generating
  technologies will be vulnerable to climate change. Here, we assess the
  impacts of climate change on wind, solar photovoltaic, hydro and
  thermoelectric power generation in Europe using a consistent modelling
  approach across the different technologies. We compare the impacts for
  different global warming scenarios: +1.5 °C, +2 °C and +3 °C. Results show
  that climate change has negative impacts on electricity production in most
  countries and for most technologies. Such impacts remain limited for a 1.5
  °C warming, and roughly double for a 3 °C warming. Impacts are relatively
  limited for solar photovoltaic and wind power potential which may reduce up
  to 10{\%}, while hydropower and thermoelectric generation may decrease by up
  to 20{\%}. Generally, impacts are more severe in southern Europe than in
  northern Europe, inducing inequity between EU countries. We show that a
  higher share of renewables could reduce the vulnerability of power generation
  to climate change, although the variability of wind and solar PV production
  remains a significant challenge.%

  This open access book showcases the burgeoning area of applied research at
  the intersection between weather and climate science and the energy industry.
  It illustrates how better communication between science and industry can help
  both sides. By opening a dialogue, scientists can understand the broader
  context for their work and the energy industry is able to keep track of and
  implement the latest scientific advances for more efficient and sustainable
  energy systems. Weather {\&} Climate Services for the Energy Industry
  considers the lessons learned in establishing an ongoing discussion between
  the energy industry and the meteorological community and how its principles
  and practises can be applied elsewhere. This book will be a useful guiding
  resource for research and early career practitioners concerned with the
  energy industry and the new field of research known as energy meteorology. 1.

  climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of

  beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth
  system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined

  A robust solar radiation dataset is essential for securing competitive
  financing for solar power projects. The majority of solar radiation datasets
  are derived from publically available data, though there are an increasing
  number of proprietary datasets being developed and marketed. Most of these
  new datasets represent models based on satellite images and validated with
  ground measured data. This paper focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of
  the existing publically available solar radiation databases, though the
  commentary is equally relevant to the newer commercial datasets. While the
  financing community generally views the solar resource as stable, it also
  views the material miscalculation of the solar resource as one of the biggest
  risks in a solar project. Therefore, lenders and rating agencies alike
  require verification of the solar resource dataset to be utilized at each
  project location as this translates directly into electric energy production
  forecasts and revenues. The variability of the solar resource as exhibited by
  the historical solar data and the accuracy of the dataset play significant
  roles in estimating the probability of future performance and influences the
  financial contract that the project is likely to receive. {\textcopyright}

  This paper explores the possibilities provided by satellite-based surface
  solar irradiation databases, for the attention of the photovoltaic actors,
  from the engineering and the financing to the operating of photovoltaic
  systems. First, the problematic of using meteorological ground stations for
  the determining of solar dataset or time-series is addressed with the example
  of the French national meteorological network and the focus made on the
  South-West part of France: the heterogeneity in terms of spatial and temporal
  representativeness along with the relevance of the delivered measurement are
  questioned. Then, an innovative synthesis of 16 satellite-based ISS databases
  available so far is presented through the distribution of their corresponding
  features within three categories: spatial and temporal representativeness,
  data type in terms of component and format, and finally operating mode for
  the retrieving of the data in terms of price and accessibility. The results
  of this review shall help photovoltaic actors making the correlation between
  the available satellite-based databases and their specific needs.%

  Integrating variable and non-dispatchable renewable power generation into
  existing power systems will have consequences for their operation and future
  expansion. These impacts will depend on two factors: (1) the variability of
  the total renewable power generation on different time scales and (2) the
  possibilities of accurately forecasting these fluctuations. In this paper,
  previous research on variability assessment and forecasting of solar, wind,
  wave and tidal energy resources is reviewed. The aim is to summarize the
  state of knowledge in each area and to compare the approaches used for the
  respective resources. For temporal variability, methods and models used for
  assessing the variability are surveyed, as well as what is known about the
  variability at individual sites and for larger aggregates of sites. For
  forecasting, an overview of forecasting methods for the different resources
  is made, and selected forecasting methods are compared over different time
  horizons. An important finding is that it is hard to draw strong conclusions
  from the existing studies due to differences in approaches and presentation
  of results. There is a need for further, more coherent studies that analyze
  the variability for the different resources in comparable ways, using data
  with the same resolution, and for studies that evaluate the smoothing effect
  and complementarity of combinations of several renewable energy resources.
  For forecasting, future research should suggest ways to evaluate forecasts
  from different renewable energy sources in easily comparable ways, using data
  from the same locations or regions, with the same temporal and spatial
  resolution, and with comparable metrics for the forecasting errors.%

  Monitored data from 100 PV systems were used to study effects of combined
  power generation of these systems, compared to the characteristics of an
  individual system. The standard deviation curve of an average daily power
  generation profile of 1 month is significantly decreased for the ensemble and
  corresponds to predictions based on cross-correlation characteristics of the
  radiation field. Power fluctuations between the monitored time intervals of
  more than 5{\%} of the installed power have disappeared. The analysed energy
  spectrum of the combined power generation reveals that the produced energy is
  generated in a range below 65{\%} of the overall installed power. The
  ensemble of PV systems supplies a calculable fraction of PV power within a
  certain time window around noon in the summer period, underlining the
  capability of reliable power production of a PV ensemble.%

  Traditionally, for the planning and assessment of solar energy systems, the
  amount of solar radiation (sunlight) incident on the Earth's surface is
  assumed to be constant over the years. However, with changing climate and air
  pollution levels, solar resources may no longer be stable over time and
  undergo substantial decadal changes. Observational records covering the past
  decades confirm long-term changes in this quantity. Here we examine how the
  latest generation of climate models used for the 5th IPCC report projects
  potential changes in surface solar radiation over the coming decades, and how
  this may affect, in combination with the expected greenhouse warming, solar
  power output from photovoltaic (PV) systems. For this purpose, projections up
  to the mid 21st century from 39 state of the art climate models from the
  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analysed globally
  and for selected key regions with major solar power production capacity. The
  large model ensemble allows to assess the degree of consistency of their
  projections. Models are largely consistent in the sign of the projected
  changes in solar radiation under cloud-free conditions as well as surface
  temperatures over most of the globe, while still reasonably consistent over a
  considerable part of the globe in the sign of changes in cloudiness and
  associated changes in solar radiation. A first order estimate of the impact
  of solar radiation and temperature changes on energy yields of PV systems
  under the RPC8.5 scenario indicates statistically significant decreases in PV
  outputs in large parts of the world, but notable exceptions with positive
  trends in large parts of Europe, South-East of North America and the
  South-East of China. Projected changes between 2006 and 2049 under the RCP8.5
  scenario overall are on the order of 1{\%}/decade for horizontal planes, but
  may be larger for tilted or tracked planes as well as on shorter (decadal)
  timescales.%

  Variations in solar radiation incident at Earth's surface profoundly affect
  the human and terrestrial environment. A decline in solar radiation at land
  surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a
  phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from
  1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the
  dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has
  been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with
  changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially
  affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.%

  There is increasing evidence that the amount of solar radiation incident at
  the Earth's surface is not stable over the years but undergoes significant
  decadal variations. Here I review the evidence for these changes, their
  magnitude, their possible causes, their representation in climate models, and
  their potential implications for climate change. The various studies
  analyzing long-term records of surface radiation measurements suggest a
  widespread decrease in surface solar radiation between the 1950s and 1980s
  (''global dimming''), with a partial recovery more recently at many locations
  (''brightening''). There are also some indications for an ''early
  brightening'' in the first part of the 20th century. These variations are in
  line with independent long-term observations of sunshine duration, diurnal
  temperature range, pan evaporation, and, more recently, satellite-derived
  estimates, which add credibility to the existence of these changes and their
  larger-scale significance. Current climate models, in general, tend to
  simulate these decadal variations to a much lesser degree. The origins of
  these variations are internal to the Earth's atmosphere and not externally
  forced by the Sun. Variations are not only found under cloudy but also under
  cloud-free atmospheres, indicative of an anthropogenic contribution through
  changes in aerosol emissions governed by economic developments and air
  pollution regulations. The relative importance of aerosols, clouds, and
  aerosol-cloud interactions may differ depending on region and pollution
  level. Highlighted are further potential implications of dimming and
  brightening for climate change, which may affect global warming, the
  components and intensity of the hydrological cycle, the carbon cycle, and the
  cryosphere among other climate elements.%

  A consistent poleward and upward shift and intensification of the storm
  tracks is found in an ensemble of 21st century climate simulations performed
  by 15 coupled climate models. The shift of the storm tracks is accompanied by
  a poleward shift and upward expansion of the midlatitude baroclinic regions
  associated with enhanced warming in the tropical upper troposphere and
  increased tropopause height. The poleward shift in baroclinicity is augmented
  in the Southern Hemisphere and partially offset in the Northern Hemisphere by
  changes in the surface meridional temperature gradient. The poleward shift of
  the storm tracks also tends to be accompanied by poleward shifts in surface
  wind stress and precipitation, and a shift towards the high index state of
  the annular modes. These results highlight the integral role that the storm
  tracks play in the climate system, and the importance of understanding how
  and why they will change in the future.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Methods applied on efficient planning of ground-based monitoring networks of
  surface solar irradiance could provide valuable scientific results and be
  useful for accurate monitoring and efficient planning of solar energy
  applications. Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and
  the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a
  novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for
  the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The
  k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the
  clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance
  due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the
  establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness
  of the proposed sites is also assessed. The proposed number of stations could
  be considered as the basis to build the climatology of surface solar
  irradiance over Greece. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  This pair of articles presents the results of a study about forecasting
  photovoltaic (PV) electricity production for some power plants in mainland
  France. Forecasts are built with statistical methods exploiting outputs from
  numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Contrary to most other studies,
  forecasts are built without using technical information on the power plants.
  In each article, several statistical methods are used to build forecast
  models and their performance is compared by means of adequate scores. When a
  best forecast emerges, its characteristics are then further assessed in order
  to get a deeper insight of its merits and flaws. The robustness of the
  results are evaluated with an intense use of cross-validation.This article
  deals with probabilistic forecasts of daily production 2. days ahead. By
  "probabilistic" we mean that our forecast models yield some quantiles of the
  expected production's probability distribution. Whereas probabilistic
  forecasts are quite usual in wind power forecasting, they are more unusual in
  the field of PV production forecasting. We show that our eight forecasts
  always perform better than a simple climatological reference forecast.
  Nevertheless, no forecast model clearly dominates the other, whatever the
  studied power plant. A post-processing technique aiming at improving
  forecasts may in fact decrease their performance. Finally, we use outputs
  from an ensemble NWP model in order to add information about the
  meteorological forecast uncertainty. Sometimes this ensemble improves the
  performance of forecasts, but this is not always true. {\textcopyright} 2014

  This work presents a cluster analysis for the determination of coherent zones
  of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) for a utility scale territory in
  California, which is serviced by San Diego Gas {\&} Electric. Knowledge of
  these coherent zones, or clusters, would allow utilities and power plants to
  realize cost savings through regional planning and operation activities such
  as the mitigation of solar power variability through the intelligent
  placement of solar farms and the optimal placement of radiometric stations.
  In order to determine such clusters, two years of gridded satellite data were
  used to describe the evolution of GHI over a portion of Southern California.
  Step changes of the average daily clear-sky index at each location are used
  to characterize the fluctuation of GHI. The k-means clustering algorithm is
  applied in conjunction with a stable initialization method to diminish its
  dependency to random initial conditions. Two validity indices are then used
  to define the quality of the cluster partitions as well as the appropriate
  number of clusters. The clustering algorithm determined an optimal number of
  14 coherent spatial clusters of similar GHI variability as the most
  appropriate segmentation of the service territory map. In addition, 14
  cluster centers are selected whose radiometric observations may serve as a
  proxy for the rest of the cluster. A correlation analysis, within and between
  the proposed clusters, based both on single-point ground-based and
  satellite-derived measurements evaluates positively the coherence of the
  conducted clustering. This method could easily be applied to any other
  utility scale region and is not dependent on GHI data which shows promise for
  the application of such clustering methods to load data and/or other
  renewable resources such as wind. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Classifying the land surface according to different climate zones is often a
  prerequisite for global diagnostic or predictive modelling studies. Classical
  classiﬁcations such as the prominent K̈oppen–Geiger (KG) approach rely
  on heuristic decision rules. Although these heuristics may transport some
  process understanding, such a discretization may appear “arbitrary” from
  a data oriented perspective. In this contribution we compare the precision of
  a KG classiﬁcation to an unsupervised classiﬁcation (k-means clustering).
  Generally speaking, we revisit the problem of “climate classiﬁcation”
  by investigating the inherent patterns in multiple data streams in a purely
  data driven way. One question is whether we can reproduce the KG boundaries
  by exploring different combinations of climate and remotely sensed vegetation
  variables. In this context we also investigate whether climate and vegetation
  variables build similar clusters. In terms of statistical performances,
  k-means clearly outperforms classical climate classiﬁcations. However, a
  subsequent stability analysis only reveals a meaningful number of clusters if
  both climate and vegetation data are considered in the analysis. This is a
  setback for the hope to explain vegetation by means of climate alone.
  Clearly, classiﬁcation schemes like K̈oppen-Geiger will play an important
  role in the future. However, future developments in this area need to be
  assessed based on data driven approaches.%

  We propose a novel methodology to select candidate locations for solar power
  plants that take into account solar variability and geographical smoothing
  effects. This methodology includes the development of maps created by a
  clustering technique that determines regions of coherent solar quality
  attributes as defined by a feature which considers both solar clearness and
  solar variability. An efficient combination of two well-known clustering
  algorithms, the affinity propagation and the k-means, is introduced in order
  to produce stable partitions of the data to a variety of number of clusters
  in a computationally fast and reliable manner. We use 15. years worth of the
  30-min GHI gridded data for the island of Lanai in Hawaii to produce,
  validate and reproduce clustering maps. A family of appropriate number of
  clusters is obtained by evaluating the performance of three internal validity
  indices. We apply a correlation analysis to the family of solutions to
  determine the map segmentation that maximizes a definite interpretation of
  the distinction between and within the emerged clusters. Having selected a
  single clustering we validated the clustering by using a new dataset to
  demonstrate that the degree of similarity between the two partitions remains
  high at 90.91{\%}. In the end we show how the clustering map can be used in
  solar energy problems. Firstly, we explore the effects of geographical
  smoothing in terms of the clustering maps, by determining the average ramp
  ratio for two location within and without the same cluster and identify the
  pair of clusters that shows the highest smoothing potential. Secondly, we
  demonstrate how the map can be used to select locations for GHI measurements
  to improve solar forecasting for a PV plant, by showing that additional
  measurements from within the cluster where the PV plant is located can lead
  to improvements of 10{\%} in the forecast.%
