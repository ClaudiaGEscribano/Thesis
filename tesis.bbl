  The statistics of hourly global radiation are analysed for various climates
  and locations, at time scales ranging from one month to one hour. The
  probabilistic and sequential properties of the hourly clearness index ktare
  related with a variety of parameters, including the daily clearness index
  Ktand the solar altitude angle h, thereby displaying the nonstationary and
  time-inhomogeneous nature of hourly radiation. Analytical expressions for the
  probability distribution of ktare proposed (truncated Gaussian functions
  depending on Ktand h). The results reported in this paper provide a deeper
  understanding of hourly solar radiation statistics, and explain some of the
  features displayed by radiation data at longer time scales. From the
  practical point of view they have implications, for example, for the
  construction of models for generating synthetic radiation data, an important
  and often indispensable tool for designing and simulating solar systems.

  This paper evaluates the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF)
  sensitivity to eight different combinations of cumulus, microphysics, and
  planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes over a
  topographically complex region in southern Spain (Andalusia) for the period
  1990–99. The WRF configuration consisted of a 10-km-resolution domain
  nested in a coarser domain driven by 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range
  Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data, with spectral nudging above the
  PBL employed over the latter domain. The model outputs have been compared at
  different time scales with an observational dataset that comprises 438 rain
  gauges and 152 temperature stations with records of both daily maximum and
  minimum temperatures. To reduce the ‘‘representation error,'' the
  validation with observations has been performed using a multistep
  regionalization that distinguishes five precipitation regions and four
  temperature regions. The analysis proves that both cumulus and PBL schemes
  have a crucial impact on the description of precipitation in Andalusia,
  whereas no noticeable differences between microphysics options were
  appreciated. Temperature is described similarly by all the configurations,
  except for the PBL choice affecting minimum values. WRF provides a definite
  improvement over ERA-40 in the climate description in terms of frequency,
  spatial distribution, and intensity of extreme events. It also captures more
  accurately the annual cycle and reduces the biases and the RMSE for monthly
  precipitation, whereas only a minor enhancement of these features was
  obtained for monthly-mean maximum and minimum temperatures. The results
  indicate that WRF is able to correctly reproduce Andalusian climate and
  produces useful added-value information for climate studies.%

  The increasing penetration of PV systems in the distribution network creates
  new opportunities but also raises several issues for the grid operation. New
  challenges, arising from the variable nature of solar energy generation, must
  be tackled in order to keep a stable and balanced power grid. In this study,
  short term variability in power output due to changing intensity due to cloud
  cover is assessed for its impact on energy delivery. Studies on this subject
  conclude that while there may be local variability, there is a strong
  reduction in that variability when the aggregate of several PV systems is
  taken into account, rather than just one PV system. The analysis shows that
  the aggregated effect of many geographically dispersed systems PV systems
  yields a smoothing effect that reduces the impact of local variability.%

  In this paper, we report two human factors studies performed to investigate
  human performance in tasks involving dextrous manipulations of virtual
  objects with haptic feedback. These studies were performed at the Man-Machine
  Interface Laboratory (Rutgers University, NJ, USA) and at the Laboratoire de
  Robotique de Paris (CRIIF-LRP). Different haptic devices were used : the
  Rutgers Master, the LRP Force Feedback Glove (LRP), and the ITR device
  (Interface Technology Research, UK). These experiments involved (1) accurate
  placements of virtual objects and (2) grasping-force regulation. In the
  former case, we compared the LRP FFG (that provides complex haptic cueing)
  and the ITR device(that provides binary haptic cueing : grasped/not grasped).
  In the latter case, we investigated the effect of sensory substitution
  (synesthetic representation of haptic informations) to convey virtual haptic
  cues using the visual and auditory sensory channels. Results of the
  experiments showed that (1) information redundancy (display of visual or
  auditory force feedback in addition to finger force feedback) allowed to
  increase performance compared to finger force feedback alone, and (2) simple
  tactual feedback (provided by the ITR device) allowed similar performance
  than complex force feedback (provided by the LRP FFG). This result led us to
  think that complex force feedback cues are not required in simple
  manipulation task (i.e. when grasping regulation forces is not crucial). In
  this case binary haptic information could be sufficient%

  A method for identifying clusters of points in a multi - dimensional
  Euclidean space is described and its application to taxonomy considered. It
  reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the
  spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the
  divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek et al. (l951a), is
  constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by
  applying the criterion of minimum within-cluster sum of squares. This
  procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits.
  The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly
  suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal
  indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a "variance
  ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The
  method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The
  results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by
  using the agglomerative method of Ward (1963) and the divisive method of
  Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).%

  We assess the impact of two sources of uncertainties in a limited area model
  (LAM) on the representation of intense precipitation: the size of the domain
  of integration and the use of the spectral nudging technique (driving of the
  large-scale within the domain of integration). We work in a perfect-model
  approach where the LAM is driven by a general circulation model (GCM) run at
  the same resolution and sharing the same physics and dynamics as the LAM. A
  set of three 50 km resolution simulations run over Western Europe with the
  LAM ALADIN-Climate and the GCM ARPEGE-Climate are performed to address this
  issue. Results are consistent with previous studies regarding the
  seasonal-mean fields. Furthermore, they show that neither the use of the
  spectral nudging nor the choice of a small domain are detrimental to the
  modelling of heavy precipitation in the present experiment.%

  The correlations of Hottel, Whillier, Liu and Jordan between diffuse and
  hemispherical, and between instantaneous (hourly) values and daily totals of
  solar radiation are recalibrated against pyrheliometer data for five stations
  in the U.S. The validity of the Liu and Jordan approach is confirmed, and
  numerical inaccuracies of the original correlations are found to arise from
  three factors: (i) reliance on uncorrected measurements of diffuse insolation
  with pyranometer plus shade ring, (ii) use of a single value of
  extraterrestrial insolation for a whole month, and (iii) neglect of seasonal
  variations in the diffuse/hemispherical ratio. The new correlation for the
  daily total ratio of diffuse over hemispherical insolation agrees with
  results reported for India, Israel and Canada which included the shade ring
  correction. This suggests that latitude independence is a good approximation.
  The new correlations imply that the diffuse component is significantly larger
  than that predicted by the original formulas of Liu and Jordan. Analytical
  expressions are presented the parameters of which are obtained by a least
  squares fit to the data. The resulting formulas provide a complete
  description of the long term average insolation incident on surfaces of
  arbitrary orientation; the only meteorological input is the long term average
  daily total of hemispherical insolation on the horizontal surface. Comparison
  between model and data shows an accuracy better than 3 per cent for the long
  term average insolation available to solar correctors, both fixed and
  tracking. The model provides a framework for optimal matching between solar
  radiation and ideal concentrators (based on the principle of phase space
  conservation). In addition to computing radiation availability for solar
  collectors, the model can be used for calculating heating and cooling loads
  of buildings. {\textcopyright} 1979.%

  Building large solar power plants requires significant long-term investment
  so understanding impacts from climate change will aid financial planning,
  technology selection, and energy output projections. In this article we
  examine how projected changes in temperature and insolation over the 21st
  century will affect photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP)
  output. Projected climate data was obtained from the coupled ocean-atmosphere
  climate models HadGEM1 and HadCM3 under the IPCC SRES A1B scenario which
  describes a future world of rapid economic growth with a balanced use of
  renewable and fossil fuel power generation. Our calculations indicate that
  under this scenario PV output from 2010 to 2080 is likely to increase by a
  few percent in Europe and China, see little change in Algeria and Australia,
  and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. CSP output is
  likely to increase by more than 10{\%} in Europe, increase by several percent
  in China and a few percent in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few
  percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. The results are robust to
  uncertainty in projected temperature change. A qualitative analysis of
  uncertainty in projected insolation change suggests strongest confidence in
  the results for Europe and least confidence in the results for western USA.
  Changes in PV and CSP output are further studied by calculating fractional
  contributions from changes in temperature and insolation. For PV there is
  considerable variation in contribution depending on location. For CSP the
  contribution from changes in insolation is always dominant.%

  The high temporal variability of solar power is a real issue to achieve a
  balanced production and consumption. Solar power forecasting is then
  necessary to better exploit this variability and to increase the penetration
  of photovoltaic power into the energy mix. Solar energy forecasting involves
  prediction of cloud property above a given point. For several hour ahead
  forecasts, using images from meteorological geostationary satellite is the
  most suitable solution. We propose a forecasting method based on a phase
  correlation algorithm for motion estimation between subsequent cloud maps
  derived from Meteosat-9 images. The method is assessed against
  state-of-the-art over a limited area over South of France for a 4-hour
  period. Cloud index maps are predicted. Our forecasting are 21 {\%} better
  than persistence in relative RMSE of cloud index. If state-of-the-art shows
  better results (23 {\%}), our algorithm reduces computing of 25 {\%} and then
  minimize operational solar forecasting constraints.%

  This study analyzes the spatial and temporal changes in sunshine duration
  (SunDu) and total cloud cover (TCC) over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and four
  subregions during 1961-2004 using high-quality, homogenized data sets. The
  analyses confirm that over most of the IP and in most seasons, SunDu and TCC
  variations are strongly negatively correlated, with absolute values
  ∼0.8-0.9. Somewhat weaker correlations (0.5-0.6) are found in the southern
  portion of the IP in summer. A large discrepancy between the SunDu and TCC
  records occurs from the 1960s until the early 1980s when the SunDu series
  shows a decrease that it is not associated with an increase in TCC. This
  negative trend or "dimming" is even more pronounced after removing the
  effects of TCC via linear regression. Since the early 1980s, the SunDu and
  TCC residual SunDu series exhibit an upward trend or "brightening." In
  addition to the long-term dimming and brightening, the volcanic eruptions of
  El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo are clearly evident in the TCC residual SunDu
  record. The TCC and SunDu records over the IP are well correlated with sea
  level pressure (SLP), with above normal TCC and below normal SunDu
  corresponding to below normal SLP locally in all seasons. The TCC and SunDu
  related SLP changes over the IP in winter and spring are part of a
  larger-scale north-south dipole pattern that extends over the entire
  Euro-Atlantic sector. Other more regional atmospheric circulation, patterns,
  identified from rotated principal component analysis, are also linked to TCC
  and SunDu variations over the IP. Finally and perhaps surprisingly, the TCC
  residual SunDu series exhibits a statistically significant relationship with
  a regional atmospheric circulation pattern during spring, summer, and autumn.

  Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for
  unsupervised dimension reduction. K-means clustering is a commonly used data
  clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks. Here we prove that
  principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster
  membership indicators for K-means clustering. New lower bounds for K-means
  objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the
  eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. These results indicate that
  unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning.
  Several implications are discussed. On dimension reduction, the result
  provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data
  reductions, beyond the conventional noisereduction explanation that PCA, via
  singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear
  approximation of the data. On learning, the result suggests effective
  techniques for K-means data clustering. DNA gene expression and Internet
  newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results. Experiments indicate that
  the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5 of the optimal values.%

  Australia has an abundant solar energy resource that is likely to be used for
  energy generation on a large scale. Variable sources of electricity
  generation require knowledge of the nature of their variability at all time
  scales. This study examines the effect that El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern
  Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have on solar radiation
  in Australia, in order to establish the role for seasonal forecasting of
  solar power. Calendar years are classified into their ENSO state using a sea
  surface temperature index. The ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis products are
  then used to estimate the effect of ENSO on global horizontal solar
  irradiance over the continent. A bootstrap technique is used to obtain
  confidence regions for the effect in both winter and summer. The main impact
  of ENSO occurs during winter over a large part of eastern Australia. Little
  impact was observed over the continent during summer. A similar analysis is
  conducted for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) to ensure that the observed ENSO
  effect is not a manifestation of the IOD. This study indicates that the ENSO
  phenomenon may account for solar energy changes of more than 10{\%} in some
  locations on a seasonal basis. We show that the solar radiation analysis is
  directly applicable to solar energy yield. Knowledge of this variability may
  influence the location of large solar generation plants. Also, there is a
  potential to predict solar energy a few months ahead by means of seasonal
  forecasting systems, which would help to assist with planning for electricity
  grid. {\textcopyright} 2011.%

  {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Renewable energy resources are variable by
  nature. Due to this fact conventional electricity systems, which were
  designed for centralized generation, have to follow a different management
  approach when a big share of these technologies take part into the system.
  The space-time variability characteristics of solar radiation, wind and
  precipitation are very different and a detailed understanding of them is
  important for an adequate planning and management of the electricity system.
  This paper is focused on solar irradiation as source of energy for
  photovoltaic (PV) generation, but the proposed scheme can generally be
  applied to other renewable resources and different solar irradiation
  applications. A comprehensive methodology to analyze variability and
  complementarity of solar resource and PV production among sub-regions of a
  wide area is developed. The photovoltaic energy yield is defined as kWh per
  kW installed, which facilitates the comparison among sub-regions and allows a
  comparison with other renewable energies like solar thermoelectric or wind
  energy. The multi-step approach facilitates the spatial evaluation and
  comparison among areas and it could be applied to different time resolutions,
  from a short term analysis to climatological perspective as well as a climate
  change projections analysis. The main steps of the method are the application
  of an objective clustering method for performing a regionalization of the
  whole domain, the ana lysis of the temporal variability of solar radiation
  and photovoltaic energy yield, and the intercomparison of the obtained
  clusters for examining their complementarity. As an implementation example,
  we make use of 30 years of daily satellite data, which is usually considered
  as the time for defining a climatology, and a long-term overview of solar
  variability is analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). In this region, the
  internal interconnections of the electrical system are strong, but the
  external interconnections are rather limited. The spatial distribution and
  variability of photovoltaic (PV) power yield is calculated for different
  tracking systems. The variability is analyzed on an interannual time scale,
  which is relevant for energy supply security and year-to-year price
  stability. The interannual variability shows robustness and stability of
  solar radiation and PV production on average for the whole domain, but with
  significant differences among clusters that could allow spatial compensation
  of PV production. The relationship between the variability of solar
  irradiation and of PV yield is not uniform among the different clusters.
  Areas where solar irradiation is higher are more sensitive to tracking type.
  The whole process described in the article provides the information of how
  solar resource and the PV energy yield perform in a limited area and provide
  the tools to analyze the relationships between sub-areas and their
  variability. In this sense, this method can be applied for isolated or nearly
  isolated electric systems located in regions with a variety of climates, or
  for interconnected systems involving several countries.%

  The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is responding to a growing
  demand for high-accuracy solar resource data with uncertainties significantly
  lower than those of existing solar resource datasets, such as the National
  Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Measurements for long-term solar resource
  characterizations require years to complete, which is an unacceptable
  timeline for the rapidly emerging needs of renewable energy applications.
  This contribution seeks methods of reducing the uncertainty of existing
  long-term solar resource datasets by incorporating lower-uncertainty
  site-specific ground measurements of a limited period of record. In
  particular, various techniques are being explored to make full use of the
  existing high-resolution radiation data available in the NSRDB and other
  sources, and extrapolate them over time using locally measured data and other
  supportive information. The interannual variability in global and direct
  radiation is studied here using long-term data at various sites. NSRDB's
  modeled data for the 1998-2005 period are compared to quality-controlled
  measurements to assess the performance of the model, which is found to vary
  greatly depending on climatic condition. The reported results are encouraging
  for applications involving concentrators at very sunny sites. Large seasonal
  biases are found at some cloudy sites. Various improvements are proposed to
  enhance the quality of the existing model and modeled data. The measurement
  of solar radiation to characterize the solar climate for renewable energy and
  other applications is a time consuming and expensive operation. Full climate
  characterization may require several decades of measurements-a prospect that
  is not practical for an industry intent on rapid deployment of solar
  technologies. This study demonstrates that the consistency of the solar
  resource in both time and space varies widely across the United States. The
  mapped results here illustrate regions with high and low variability and
  provide readers with quick visual information to help them decide where and
  how long measurements should be taken for a particular application. The
  underlying data that form these maps are also available from NREL to provide
  users the opportunity for more detailed analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011.%

  Wind energy is susceptible to global climate change because it could alter
  the wind patterns. Then, improvement of our knowledge of wind field
  variability is crucial to optimize the use of wind resources in a given
  region. Here, we quantify the effects of climate change on the surface wind
  speed field over the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands using an ensemble
  of four regional climate models driven by a global climate model. Regions of
  the Iberian Peninsula with coherent temporal variability in wind speed in
  each of the models are identified and analysed using cluster analysis. These
  regions are continuous in each model and exhibit a high degree of overlap
  across the models. The models forced by the European Reanalysis Interim
  (ERA-Interim) reanalysis are validated against the European Climate
  Assessment and Dataset wind. We find that regional models are able to
  simulate with reasonable skill the spatial distribution of wind speed at 10 m
  in the Iberian Peninsula, identifying areas with common wind variability.
  Under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B climate change
  scenario, the wind speed in the identified regions for 2031–2050 is up to
  5{\%} less than during the 1980–1999 control period for all models. The
  models also agree on the time evolution of spatially averaged wind speed in
  each region, showing a negative trend for all of them. These tendencies
  depend on the region and are significant at p = 5{\%} or slightly more for
  annual trends, while seasonal trends are not significant in most of the
  regions and seasons. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons,

  We present a European land-only daily high-resolution gridded data set for
  precipitation and minimum, maximum, and mean surface temperature for the
  period 1950–2006. This data set improves on previous products in its
  spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations,
  and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial
  interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered
  on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as
  well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in
  use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box
  averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We
  employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the
  monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using
  three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies
  using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an
  external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily
  estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily
  standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across
  the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number
  of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on
  the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal
  reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with
  return periods up to 10 years.%

  Europe is investing considerably in renewable energies for a sustainable
  future, with both Iberian countries (Portugal and Spain) promoting
  significantly new hydropower, wind, and solar plants. The climate variability
  in this area is highly controlled by just a few large-scale teleconnection
  modes. However, the relationship between these modes and the renewable
  climate-dependent energy resources has not yet been established in detail.
  The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the North Atlantic
  Oscillation (NAO) on the interannual variability of the main and primary
  renewable energy resources in Iberia. This is achieved through a holistic
  assessment that is based on a 10-km-resolution climate simulation spanning
  the period 1959–2007 that provides physically consistent data of the
  various magnitudes involved. A monthly analysis for the ex- tended winter
  (October–March) months shows that negativeNAOphases enhance wind speeds
  (10{\%}–15{\%}) and, thereby, wind power (estimated around 30{\%} at
  typical wind-turbine altitudes) and hydropower re- sources (with changes in
  precipitation exceeding 100{\%} and implying prolonged responses in reservoir
  storage and release throughout the year), while diminishing the solar
  potential (10{\%}–20{\%}). Opposite signals were also sporadically
  identified, being well explained when taking into account the orography and
  the prevailing wind direction during bothNAOphases.Anadditional analysis
  using real wind, hydropower, and solar power generation data further confirms
  the strong signature of the NAO.%

  Renewable energies arise as part of both economic development plans and
  mitigation strategies aimed at abating climate change. Contrariwise, most
  renewable energies are potentially vulnerable to climate change, which could
  affect in particular solar and wind power. Proper evaluations of this two-way
  climate-renewable energy relationship require detailed information of the
  geographical location of the renewable energy fleets. However, this
  information is usually provided as total amounts installed per administrative
  region, especially with respect to future planned installations. To help
  overcome this limiting issue, the objective of this contribution was to
  develop the so-called CLIMIX model: a tool that performs a realistic spatial
  allocation of given amounts of both photovoltaic (PV) and wind power
  installed capacities and evaluates the energy generated under varying climate
  conditions. This is done over a regular grid so that the created scenarios
  can be directly used in conjunction with outputs of climate models. First, we
  used the 0.44° resolution grid defined for the EURO-CORDEX project and
  applied the CLIMIX model to spatially allocate total amounts of both
  unreported 2012 and future 2020 PV and wind power installations in Europe at
  the country level. Second, we performed a validation exercise using the
  various options for estimating PV and wind power production under the created
  scenarios that are included in the model. The results revealed an acceptable
  agreement between the estimated and the recorded power production values in
  every European country. Lastly, we estimated increases in power production
  derived from the future deployment of new renewable units, often obtaining
  non-direct relationships. This latter further emphasizes the need of accurate
  spatially-resolved PV and wind power scenarios in order to perform reliable
  estimations of power production.%

  The analysis of the influence of future climatic variations on air quality
  needs of methods that give a space-time display of large atmospheric data
  related to air pollution. Here a new approach in order to assess the impacts
  of climate change on the patterns of variation of secondary inorganic
  aerosols (SIA) over Europe is presented. The most widely used method of
  analysis (selected time-slices, future-minus-present method) is very
  sensitive to the chosen control and future periods because of the internal
  variability of the climate system. In order to overcome this limitation, full
  transient simulations for the period 1991-2100 under the SRES A2 scenario are
  analysed by the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) methodology in order
  minimise the uncertainty associated to the internal variability due to the
  longer time series obtained. The results indicate that the EOF1 accounts for
  around 30-45{\%} of the total variance for the SIA levels and points out a
  general increase of its trend over the entire domain (p{\textless} 0.005),
  except in the case of nitrate, whose change signal is not significant
  (p{\textgreater} 0.1). The correlation between SIA and meteorological
  parameters indicates that the trends and patterns of variation of aerosols
  are related to the higher temperature projected for the future climate. It
  favours the formation of sulphates and ammonium (increasing the
  concentrations of atmospheric oxidants) and the decomposition of ammonium
  nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the decreases in precipitation
  have a strong effect on the frequency of the washout and therefore in the
  levels of aerosols. The concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing
  precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. The trend
  from a decreasing mixing height found in several areas of Europe is
  frequently related to a decrease in precipitation, representing an adding
  effect for the enhanced future SIA concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2010

  Time-scale and extent at which large-scale circulation modes determine the

  Lett. 8 044035 Abstract The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East
  Atlantic (EA) and the Scandinavian (SCAND) modes are the three main
  large-scale circulation patterns driving the climate variability of the
  Iberian Peninsula. This study assesses their influence in terms of solar
  (photovoltaic) and wind power generation potential (SP and WP) and evaluates
  their skill as predictors. For that we use a hindcast regional climate
  simulation to retrieve the primary meteorological variables involved, surface
  solar radiation and wind speed. First we identify that the maximum influence
  of the various modes occurs on the interannual variations of the monthly mean
  SP and WP series, being generally more relevant in winter. Second we find
  that in this time-scale and season, SP (WP) varies up to 30{\%} (40{\%}) with
  respect to the mean climatology between years with opposite phases of the
  modes, although the strength and the spatial distribution of the signals
  differ from one month to another. Last, the skill of a multi-linear
  regression model (MLRM), built using the NAO, EA and SCAND indices, to
  reconstruct the original wintertime monthly series of SP and WP was
  investigated. The reconstructed series (when the MLRM is calibrated for each
  month individually) correlate with the original ones up to 0.8 at the
  interannual time-scale. Besides, when the modeled series for each individual
  month are merged to construct an October-to-March monthly series, and after
  removing the annual cycle in order to account for monthly anomalies, these
  correlate 0.65 (0.55) with the original SP (WP) series in average. These
  values remain fairly stable when the calibration and reconstruction periods
  differ, thus supporting up to a point the predictive potential of the method
  at the time-scale assessed here.%

  The Earth?s radiation budget is essential for driving the general circulation
  of the atmosphere and ocean, and for building the main conditions for the
  Earth's climate system. To detect changes in the Earth?s surface radiation
  field the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and its central archive -
  the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) - was created in 1992. BSRN is a
  project of the Radiation Panel (now the Data and Assessment Panel) from the
  Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) under the umbrella of the
  World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). It is the global baseline network
  for surface radiation for the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS),
  contributing to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW), and forming a cooperative
  network with the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change
  (NDACC). The data are of primary importance in supporting the validation and
  confirmation of satellite and computer model estimates. At a relatively small
  number of stations (currently 58) in contrasting climatic zones, solar and
  atmospheric radiation is measured with instruments of the highest available
  accuracy and with high temporal resolution (mainly 1 minute). A total of
  about 7000 station-month datasets were available in the WRMC in mid 2013. All
  data are interactively accessible to external users for bona fide research
  purposes at no cost. This report provides information for scientists
  interested in high quality surface radiation data as well as for scientists
  running a BSRN station. It offers information about the available data, the
  data access and describes tools to visualize the data and to check their
  quality.%

  Although now over 100 years old, the classification$\backslash$nof climate
  originally formulated by Wladimir K¨oppen$\backslash$nand modified by his
  collaborators and successors, is still in$\backslash$nwidespread use. It is
  widely used in teaching school and$\backslash$nundergraduate courses on
  climate. It is also still in regular$\backslash$nuse by researchers across a
  range of disciplines as a basis$\backslash$nfor climatic regionalisation of
  variables and for assessing the$\backslash$noutput of global climate models.
  Here we have produced a$\backslash$nnew global map of climate using the
  K¨oppen-Geiger system$\backslash$nbased on a large global data set of
  long-term monthly precipitation$\backslash$nand temperature station time
  series. Climatic variables$\backslash$nused in the K¨oppen-Geiger system
  were calculated at$\backslash$neach station and interpolated between stations
  using a twodimensional$\backslash$n(latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline
  with$\backslash$ntension onto a 0.1×0.1 grid for each continent. We
  discuss$\backslash$nsome problems in dealing with sites that are not
  uniquely$\backslash$nclassified into one climate type by the K¨oppen-Geiger
  system$\backslash$nand assess the outcomes on a continent by
  continent$\backslash$nbasis. Globally the most common climate type by
  land$\backslash$narea is BWh (14.2{\%}, Hot desert) followed by Aw

  Photovoltaic (PV) modules in real operation present angular losses in
  reference to their behaviour in standard test conditions, due to the angle of
  incidence of the incident radiation and the surface soil. Although these
  losses are not always negligible, they are commonly not taken into account
  when correcting the electrical characteristics of the PV module or estimating
  the energy production of PV systems. The main reason of this approximation is
  the lack of easy-to-use mathematical expressions for the angular losses
  calculation. This paper analyses these losses on PV modules and presents an
  analytical model based on theoretical and experimental results. The proposed
  model fits monocrystalline as well as polycrystalline and amorphous silicon
  PV modules, and contemplates the existence of superficial dust. With it
  angular losses integrated over time periods of interest can be easily
  calculated. Monthly and annual losses have been calculated for 10 different
  European sites, having diverse climates and latitudes (ranging from 32?? to
  52??), and considering different module tilt angles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science

  Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to retrieve the
  aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In parallel, AOD
  climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also
  available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol
  types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of
  this unique multiyear database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment
  by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, seasalt, sulfate, black and
  organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products:
  NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS,
  ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical
  datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth-Probe) and
  METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from
  Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4,
  the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS
  and MACC. Ground-based Level- 2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations
  around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The
  sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this
  region, showing a relevant spatiotemporal variability and highlighting high
  dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate
  aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows
  limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard
  products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the
  basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to
  underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to
  MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical
  dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study
  confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a
  large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are
  confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D
  blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time
  series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the
  Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the
  2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from
  AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC
  reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations,
  which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology.We extend the
  2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the
  2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate
  aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the
  Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties
  of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie
  calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate
  models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosolclimate studies.%

  Since the 1980s anthropogenic aerosols have been considerably reduced in
  Europe and the Mediterranean area. This decrease is often considered as the
  likely cause of the brightening effect observed over the same period. This
  phenomenon is however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate
  models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled
  regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain
  81 ± 16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the
  surface warming simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct
  aerosol effect is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated
  brightening. The comparison between regional simulations and homogenized
  ground-based observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as
  well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the
  Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the
  realistic aerosol variations.%

  models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled
  regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain
  81 ± 16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the
  surface warming simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct
  aerosol effect is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated
  brightening. The comparison between regional simulations and homogenized
  ground-based observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as
  well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the
  Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the
  realistic aerosol variations.%

  To support climate research, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)
  initiated a new radiometric network, the Baseline Surface Radiation Network
  (BSRN). The network aims at providing validation material for satellite radi-
  ometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term variations
  in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play an
  important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are
  designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required
  to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long
  period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these
  goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and
  the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all
  stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics
  (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored
  at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center
  (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at
  stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be
  stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred
  to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN,
  consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S,
  and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to
  scientific communities in vari- ous ways depending on the communication
  environment of the users. The present article discusses the scientific base,
  organizational and technical aspects of the network, and data retrieval
  methods; shows various application possibilities; and presents the future
  tasks to be accomplished.%

  The energy produced by a photovoltaic system over a given period can be
  estimated from the incident radiation at the site where the Grid Connected PV
  System (GCPVS) is located, assuming knowledge of certain basic features of
  the system under study. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of solar
  radiation, the question "How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this
  location over the next few years?" involves an exercise of prediction
  inevitably subjected to a degree of uncertainty. Moreover, during the life
  cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: "Is the system working
  correctly?". This paper proposes and examines several methods to cope with
  these questions. The daily performance of a PV system is simulated. This
  simulation and the interannual variability of both radiation and productivity
  are statistically analyzed. From the results several regression adjustments
  are obtained. This analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity
  prediction and performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical
  analysis of the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method
  of malfunctioning parts of the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  The solaR package allows for reproducible research both for photovoltaics

  addition, the package provides a tool for the visual statistical analysis of
  the performance of a large PV plant composed of several systems. Although
  solaR is primarily designed for time series associated to a location defined

  A power conversion efficiency record of 10.1{\%} was achieved for kesterite
  absorbers, using a Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)4 thin-film solar cell made by
  hydrazine-based solution processing. Key device characteristics were
  compiled, including light/dark J–V, quantum efficiency, temperature
  dependence of Voc and series resistance, photoluminescence, and capacitance
  spectroscopy, providing important insight into how the devices compare with
  high-performance Cu(In,Ga)Se2. The record kesterite device was shown to be
  primarily limited by interface recombination, minority carrier lifetime, and

  This paper analyzes the correlation between the fluctuations of the
  electrical power generated by the ensemble of 70. DC/AC inverters from a
  45.6. MW PV plant. The use of real electrical power time series from a large
  collection of photovoltaic inverters of a same plant is an important
  contribution in the context of models built upon simplified assumptions to
  overcome the absence of such data. This data set is divided into three
  different fluctuation categories with a clustering procedure which performs
  correctly with the clearness index and the wavelet variances. Afterwards, the
  time dependent correlation between the electrical power time series of the
  inverters is estimated with the wavelet transform. The wavelet correlation
  depends on the distance between the inverters, the wavelet time scales and
  the daily fluctuation level. Correlation values for time scales below one
  minute are low without dependence on the daily fluctuation level. For time
  scales above 20. min, positive high correlation values are obtained, and the
  decay rate with the distance depends on the daily fluctuation level. At
  intermediate time scales the correlation depends strongly on the daily
  fluctuation level. The proposed methods have been implemented using free
  software. Source code is available as supplementary material.

  A study on the spatial variability of long term solar radiation in Vietnam
  and the results of clustering solar radiation into different regions are
  presented here. Vietnam has a dense and long network of sunshine duration
  measurements, and on the contrary the country has a scarce availability of
  solar irradiance measuring sites. The variability of long term solar
  radiation can be analyzed by determining daily global irradiation from
  sunshine duration. A model inspired in Angstrom equation has been developed
  using the canonical correlation analysis with good performance. The output of
  the model has been used for characterizing the dispersion of long term solar
  radiation and its spatial distribution has been also studied by clustering
  techniques. The comparison with the K{\"{o}}ppen climatic information remarks
  that Vietnam could be divided into 3-4 well defined zones of different solar
  radiation variability.%

  Solar surface irradiance (SIS) and direct (SID) irradiance as well as
  effective cloud albedo (CAL) climate data records (CDR) derived from the
  Meteosat first generation satellites (Meteosats 2 to 7, 1983-2005) are
  presented. The CDRs are available free of charge for all purposes from
  wui.cmsaf.eu at monthly, daily and hourly means at a spatial resolution of
  0.03.The processing employed a climate version of the Heliosat algorithm
  combined with a clear sky model using an eigenvector look-up table method.
  Modifications to the Heliosat method include a self-calibration algorithm as
  well as a running mean based clear sky retrieval algorithm.The datasets are
  validated using ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation
  Network (BSRN) as a reference. The validation threshold for the mean absolute
  bias between satellite-derived and surface-measured radiation is given by the
  target accuracy for solar irradiance fields defined by the Global Climate
  Observing system (GCOS) and a measurement uncertainty for the surface data.
  The results demonstrate that the target accuracy is achieved for monthly and
  daily means. Furthermore, an intercomparison with similar datasets reveal a
  better performance and climate monitoring potential of the CM SAF SIS CDR at
  most BSRN sites compared to established data sets like e.g. ERA-reanalysis,
  GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International
  Satellite Cloud Climatology Project). Lastly, the realistic representation of
  both seasonal and inter-annual variability guarantees the applicability of
  the satellite-based climate data sets for climate monitoring and analysis of
  extremes.No trends in the normalized bias between the CM SAF and the BSRN
  datasets are detectable, which demonstrates the stability and homogeneity of
  the global and direct irradiance for the period covered by BSRN measurements.
  However, inconsistencies are detectable at few satellite transition dates for
  certain regions in earlier years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.%

  maximum positive values (+0.75) over the Iberian Peninsula, and maximum
  negative values (−0.71) over Norway. Reanalysis results confirm these
  findings. Composite analysis shows, for northern Europe, negative anomalies

  The importance for reliable forecasts of incoming solar radiation is growing
  rapidly, especially for those countries with an increasing share in
  photovoltaic (PV) power production. The reliability of solar radiation
  forecasts depends mainly on the representation of clouds and aerosol
  particles absorbing and scattering radiation. Especially under extreme
  aerosol conditions, numerical weather prediction has a systematic bias in the
  solar radiation forecast. This is caused by the design of numerical weather
  prediction models, which typically account for the direct impact of aerosol
  particles on radiation using climatological mean values and the impact on
  cloud formation assuming spatially and temporally homogeneous aerosol
  concentrations. These model deficiencies in turn can lead to significant
  economic losses under extreme aerosol conditions. For Germany, Saharan dust
  outbreaks occurring 5 to 15 times per year for several days each are
  prominent examples for conditions, under which numerical weather prediction
  struggles to forecast solar radiation adequately. We investigate the impact
  of mineral dust on the PV power generation during a Saharan dust outbreak
  over Germany at 4 April 2014 using ICON-ART, which is the current German
  numerical weather prediction model extended by modules accounting for trace
  substances and related feedback processes. We find an overall improvement of
  the PV power forecast for 65{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the pyranometer stations in
  Germany. Of the nine stations with very high differences between forecast and
  measurement, eight stations show an improvement. Furthermore, we quantify the
  direct radiative effects and indirect radiative effects of mineral dust. For
  our study, direct effects account for 64{\&}thinsp;{\%}, indirect effects for
  20{\&}thinsp;{\%} and synergistic interaction effects for 16{\&}thinsp;{\%}
  of the differences between the forecast including mineral dust radiative
  effects and the forecast neglecting mineral dust.%

  Many clustering and segmentation algorithms both suffer from the limitation
  that the number of clusters/segments are specified by a human user. It is
  often impractical to expect a human with sufficient domain knowledge to be
  available to select the number of clusters/segments to return. In this paper,
  we investigate techniques to determine the number of clusters or segments to
  return from hierarchical clustering and segmentation algorithms. We propose
  an efficient algorithm, the L method, that finds the knee in a of clusters
  vs. clustering evaluation metric graph. Using the knee is well-known, but is
  not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of
  clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine
  in which situations it will and will not work. We also compare the L method
  to existing methods based on the accuracy of the number of clusters that are
  determined and efficiency. Our results show favorable performance for these
  criteria compared to the existing methods that were evaluated.%

  Abstract There is a growing interest in the study of decadal variations in
  surface solar radiation during the last decades, although the analyses of
  long-term time series in some areas with major gaps in observations, such as
  in Spain, are still pending. This work describes for the first time the
  development of a new dataset of surface solar radiation in Spain based on the
  longest series with records of global solar radiation (G), most of them
  starting in the early 1980s. Additional records of diffuse solar radiation
  (D), which is a component of G much less studied due to the general scarcity
  of long-term series, are available for some of these series. Particular
  emphasis is placed upon the homogenization of this dataset in order to ensure
  the reliability of the trends, which can be affected by non-natural factors
  such as relocations or changes of instruments. The mean annual G series over
  Spain shows a tendency to increase during the 1985–2010 period, with a
  significant linear trend of + 3.9 W m− 2 per decade. Similar significant
  increases are observed in the mean seasonal series, with the highest rate of
  change during summer (+ 6.5 W m− 2 per decade) and secondly in autumn (+
  4.1 W m− 2 per decade) and spring (+ 3.2 W m− 2 per decade). These
  results are in line with the widespread increase of G, also known as
  brightening period, reported at many worldwide observation sites.
  Furthermore, the annual mean D series starts without relevant variations
  during the second half of the 1980s, but it is disturbed by a strong increase
  in 1991 and 1992, which might reflect the signal of the Pinatubo volcanic
  eruption. Afterwards, the mean series shows a tendency to decrease up to the
  mid-2000s, with a significant linear trend of − 2.1 W m− 2 per decade
  during the 1985–2010 period. All these results point towards a diminution
  of clouds and/or aerosols over the area.%

  Integrating variable and non-dispatchable renewable power generation into
  existing power systems will have consequences for their operation and future
  expansion. These impacts will depend on two factors: (1) the variability of
  the total renewable power generation on different time scales and (2) the
  possibilities of accurately forecasting these fluctuations. In this paper,
  previous research on variability assessment and forecasting of solar, wind,
  wave and tidal energy resources is reviewed. The aim is to summarize the
  state of knowledge in each area and to compare the approaches used for the
  respective resources. For temporal variability, methods and models used for
  assessing the variability are surveyed, as well as what is known about the
  variability at individual sites and for larger aggregates of sites. For
  forecasting, an overview of forecasting methods for the different resources
  is made, and selected forecasting methods are compared over different time
  horizons. An important finding is that it is hard to draw strong conclusions
  from the existing studies due to differences in approaches and presentation
  of results. There is a need for further, more coherent studies that analyze
  the variability for the different resources in comparable ways, using data
  with the same resolution, and for studies that evaluate the smoothing effect
  and complementarity of combinations of several renewable energy resources.
  For forecasting, future research should suggest ways to evaluate forecasts
  from different renewable energy sources in easily comparable ways, using data
  from the same locations or regions, with the same temporal and spatial
  resolution, and with comparable metrics for the forecasting errors.%

  Variations in solar radiation incident at Earth's surface profoundly affect
  the human and terrestrial environment. A decline in solar radiation at land
  surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a
  phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from
  1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the
  dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has
  been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with
  changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially
  affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.%

  Methods applied on efficient planning of ground-based monitoring networks of
  surface solar irradiance could provide valuable scientific results and be
  useful for accurate monitoring and efficient planning of solar energy
  applications. Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and
  the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a
  novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for
  the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The
  k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the
  clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance
  due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the
  establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness
  of the proposed sites is also assessed. The proposed number of stations could
  be considered as the basis to build the climatology of surface solar
  irradiance over Greece. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  This pair of articles presents the results of a study about forecasting
  photovoltaic (PV) electricity production for some power plants in mainland
  France. Forecasts are built with statistical methods exploiting outputs from
  numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Contrary to most other studies,
  forecasts are built without using technical information on the power plants.
  In each article, several statistical methods are used to build forecast
  models and their performance is compared by means of adequate scores. When a
  best forecast emerges, its characteristics are then further assessed in order
  to get a deeper insight of its merits and flaws. The robustness of the
  results are evaluated with an intense use of cross-validation.This article
  deals with probabilistic forecasts of daily production 2. days ahead. By
  "probabilistic" we mean that our forecast models yield some quantiles of the
  expected production's probability distribution. Whereas probabilistic
  forecasts are quite usual in wind power forecasting, they are more unusual in
  the field of PV production forecasting. We show that our eight forecasts
  always perform better than a simple climatological reference forecast.
  Nevertheless, no forecast model clearly dominates the other, whatever the
  studied power plant. A post-processing technique aiming at improving
  forecasts may in fact decrease their performance. Finally, we use outputs
  from an ensemble NWP model in order to add information about the
  meteorological forecast uncertainty. Sometimes this ensemble improves the
  performance of forecasts, but this is not always true. {\textcopyright} 2014

  \field{abstract}{%
  This work presents a cluster analysis for the determination of coherent zones
  of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) for a utility scale territory in
  California, which is serviced by San Diego Gas {\&} Electric. Knowledge of
  these coherent zones, or clusters, would allow utilities and power plants to
  realize cost savings through regional planning and operation activities such
  as the mitigation of solar power variability through the intelligent
  placement of solar farms and the optimal placement of radiometric stations.
  In order to determine such clusters, two years of gridded satellite data were
  used to describe the evolution of GHI over a portion of Southern California.
  Step changes of the average daily clear-sky index at each location are used
  to characterize the fluctuation of GHI. The k-means clustering algorithm is
  applied in conjunction with a stable initialization method to diminish its
  dependency to random initial conditions. Two validity indices are then used
  to define the quality of the cluster partitions as well as the appropriate
  number of clusters. The clustering algorithm determined an optimal number of
  14 coherent spatial clusters of similar GHI variability as the most
  appropriate segmentation of the service territory map. In addition, 14
  cluster centers are selected whose radiometric observations may serve as a
  proxy for the rest of the cluster. A correlation analysis, within and between
  the proposed clusters, based both on single-point ground-based and
  satellite-derived measurements evaluates positively the coherence of the
  conducted clustering. This method could easily be applied to any other
  utility scale region and is not dependent on GHI data which shows promise for
  the application of such clustering methods to load data and/or other
  renewable resources such as wind. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  We propose a novel methodology to select candidate locations for solar power
  plants that take into account solar variability and geographical smoothing
  effects. This methodology includes the development of maps created by a
  clustering technique that determines regions of coherent solar quality
  attributes as defined by a feature which considers both solar clearness and
  solar variability. An efficient combination of two well-known clustering
  algorithms, the affinity propagation and the k-means, is introduced in order
  to produce stable partitions of the data to a variety of number of clusters
  in a computationally fast and reliable manner. We use 15. years worth of the
  30-min GHI gridded data for the island of Lanai in Hawaii to produce,
  validate and reproduce clustering maps. A family of appropriate number of
  clusters is obtained by evaluating the performance of three internal validity
  indices. We apply a correlation analysis to the family of solutions to
  determine the map segmentation that maximizes a definite interpretation of
  the distinction between and within the emerged clusters. Having selected a
  single clustering we validated the clustering by using a new dataset to
  demonstrate that the degree of similarity between the two partitions remains
  high at 90.91{\%}. In the end we show how the clustering map can be used in
  solar energy problems. Firstly, we explore the effects of geographical
  smoothing in terms of the clustering maps, by determining the average ramp
  ratio for two location within and without the same cluster and identify the
  pair of clusters that shows the highest smoothing potential. Secondly, we
  demonstrate how the map can be used to select locations for GHI measurements
  to improve solar forecasting for a PV plant, by showing that additional
  measurements from within the cluster where the PV plant is located can lead
  to improvements of 10{\%} in the forecast.%
