  The statistics of hourly global radiation are analysed for various climates
  and locations, at time scales ranging from one month to one hour. The
  probabilistic and sequential properties of the hourly clearness index ktare
  related with a variety of parameters, including the daily clearness index
  Ktand the solar altitude angle h, thereby displaying the nonstationary and
  time-inhomogeneous nature of hourly radiation. Analytical expressions for the
  probability distribution of ktare proposed (truncated Gaussian functions
  depending on Ktand h). The results reported in this paper provide a deeper
  understanding of hourly solar radiation statistics, and explain some of the
  features displayed by radiation data at longer time scales. From the
  practical point of view they have implications, for example, for the
  construction of models for generating synthetic radiation data, an important
  and often indispensable tool for designing and simulating solar systems.

  Forecasting the AC power output of a PV plant accurately is important both
  for plant owners and electric system operators. Two main categories of PV
  modeling are available: the parametric and the nonparametric. In this paper,
  a methodology using a nonparametric PV model is proposed, using as inputs
  several forecasts of meteorological variables from a Numerical Weather
  Forecast model, and actual AC power measurements of PV plants. The
  methodology was built upon the R environment and uses Quantile Regression
  Forests as machine learning tool to forecast AC power with a confidence
  interval. Real data from five PV plants was used to validate the methodology,
  and results show that daily production is predicted with an absolute cvMBE
  lower than 1.3{\%}.%

  This paper evaluates the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF)
  sensitivity to eight different combinations of cumulus, microphysics, and
  planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes over a
  topographically complex region in southern Spain (Andalusia) for the period
  1990–99. The WRF configuration consisted of a 10-km-resolution domain
  nested in a coarser domain driven by 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range
  Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data, with spectral nudging above the
  PBL employed over the latter domain. The model outputs have been compared at
  different time scales with an observational dataset that comprises 438 rain
  gauges and 152 temperature stations with records of both daily maximum and
  minimum temperatures. To reduce the ‘‘representation error,'' the
  validation with observations has been performed using a multistep
  regionalization that distinguishes five precipitation regions and four
  temperature regions. The analysis proves that both cumulus and PBL schemes
  have a crucial impact on the description of precipitation in Andalusia,
  whereas no noticeable differences between microphysics options were
  appreciated. Temperature is described similarly by all the configurations,
  except for the PBL choice affecting minimum values. WRF provides a definite
  improvement over ERA-40 in the climate description in terms of frequency,
  spatial distribution, and intensity of extreme events. It also captures more
  accurately the annual cycle and reduces the biases and the RMSE for monthly
  precipitation, whereas only a minor enhancement of these features was
  obtained for monthly-mean maximum and minimum temperatures. The results
  indicate that WRF is able to correctly reproduce Andalusian climate and
  produces useful added-value information for climate studies.%

  The increasing penetration of PV systems in the distribution network creates
  new opportunities but also raises several issues for the grid operation. New
  challenges, arising from the variable nature of solar energy generation, must
  be tackled in order to keep a stable and balanced power grid. In this study,
  short term variability in power output due to changing intensity due to cloud
  cover is assessed for its impact on energy delivery. Studies on this subject
  conclude that while there may be local variability, there is a strong
  reduction in that variability when the aggregate of several PV systems is
  taken into account, rather than just one PV system. The analysis shows that
  the aggregated effect of many geographically dispersed systems PV systems
  yields a smoothing effect that reduces the impact of local variability.%

  The objective of the present work is to compare the projections of surface
  solar radiation (SSR) simulated by four regional climate models (CCLM, RCA4,
  WRF, ALADIN) with the respective fields of their ten driving CMIP5 global
  climate models. First the annual and seasonal SSR changes are examined in the
  regional and in the global climate models based on the RCP8.5 emission
  scenarios. The results show significant discrepancies between the projected
  SSR, the multi-model mean of RCMs indicates a decrease in SSR of
  −0.60 W/m2 per decade over Europe, while the multi-model mean of the
  associated GCMs used to drive the RCMs gives an increase in SSR of
  +0.39 W/m2 per decade for the period of 2006--2100 over Europe. At seasonal
  scale the largest differences appear in spring and summer. The different
  signs of SSR projected changes can be interpreted as the consequence of the
  different behavior of cloud cover in global and regional climate models.
  Cloudiness shows a significant decline in GCMs with −0.24{\%} per decade
  which explains the extra income in SSR, while in case of the regional models
  no significant changes in cloudiness can be detected. The reduction of SSR in
  RCMs can be attributed to increasing atmospheric absorption in line with the
  increase of water vapor content. Both global and regional models overestimate
  SSR in absolute terms as compared to surface observations, in line with an
  underestimation of cloud cover. Regional models further have difficulties to
  adequately reproduce the observed trends in SSR over the past decades.%

  In this paper, we report two human factors studies performed to investigate
  human performance in tasks involving dextrous manipulations of virtual
  objects with haptic feedback. These studies were performed at the Man-Machine
  Interface Laboratory (Rutgers University, NJ, USA) and at the Laboratoire de
  Robotique de Paris (CRIIF-LRP). Different haptic devices were used : the
  Rutgers Master, the LRP Force Feedback Glove (LRP), and the ITR device
  (Interface Technology Research, UK). These experiments involved (1) accurate
  placements of virtual objects and (2) grasping-force regulation. In the
  former case, we compared the LRP FFG (that provides complex haptic cueing)
  and the ITR device(that provides binary haptic cueing : grasped/not grasped).
  In the latter case, we investigated the effect of sensory substitution
  (synesthetic representation of haptic informations) to convey virtual haptic
  cues using the visual and auditory sensory channels. Results of the
  experiments showed that (1) information redundancy (display of visual or
  auditory force feedback in addition to finger force feedback) allowed to
  increase performance compared to finger force feedback alone, and (2) simple
  tactual feedback (provided by the ITR device) allowed similar performance
  than complex force feedback (provided by the LRP FFG). This result led us to
  think that complex force feedback cues are not required in simple
  manipulation task (i.e. when grasping regulation forces is not crucial). In
  this case binary haptic information could be sufficient%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A review of more than 60 studies (plus m4ore than 65 studies on P2G) on power
  and energy models based on simulation and optimization was done. Based on
  these, for power systems with up to 95{\%} renewables, the electricity
  storage size is found to be below 1.5{\%} of the annual demand (in energy
  terms). While for 100{\%} renewables energy systems (power, heat, mobility),
  it can remain below 6{\%} of the annual energy demand. Combination of sectors
  and diverting the electricity to another sector can play a large role in
  reducing the storage size. From the potential alternatives to satisfy this
  demand, pumped hydro storage (PHS) global potential is not enough and new
  technologies with a higher energy density are needed. Hydrogen, with more
  than 250 times the energy density of PHS is a potential option to satisfy the
  storage need. However, changes needed in infrastructure to deal with high
  hydrogen content and the suitability of salt caverns for its storage can pose
  limitations for this technology. Power to Gas (P2G) arises as possible
  alternative overcoming both the facilities and the energy density issues. The
  global storage requirement would represent only 2{\%} of the global annual
  natural gas production or 10{\%} of the gas storage facilities (in energy
  equivalent). The more options considered to deal with intermittent sources,
  the lower the storage requirement will be. Therefore, future studies aiming
  to quantify storage needs should focus on the entire energy system including
  technology vectors (e.g. Power to Heat, Liquid, Gas, Chemicals) to avoid
  overestimating the amount of storage needed.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The combination of hydroelectric and photovoltaic sources of energy in a
  generation system may seem unfeasible due to the still quite high costs of
  the photovoltaic plants. However in the next few decades, significant
  reductions in those costs are to be expected. Moreover, this combination may
  reduce the cost of plants implemented in low hydroelectric potential sites
  for which main system interconnection costs prove prohibitive. The study of
  hybrid hydro-PV generating plants allows the evaluation of the use of water
  reservoirs and battery banks as alternatives for energy storage within a
  system. It also allows the evaluation of the advantages of generation from
  complementary energy sources. The objectives of this paper is to propose the
  concept of a theoretical performance limit for the plants and propose a
  method for the determination of this performance limit using computer
  simulations with idealized energy availability functions. Using this method,
  the effect of different degrees of complementarity in time of the energy
  resources on the performance of hydro PV plants is studied. It has been
  observed that, as expected, the smallest failure indexes measuring the energy
  supply to the consumers are associated to the best complementarity in time
  indexes. The results of the simulations led to the synthesis of failure index
  curves, as functions of the different degrees of complementarity in time,
  with data obtained solely with the utilization of idealized functions
  describing the energy availabilities, as proposed in this work. The results
  so obtained are a preliminary set treating the influence of the
  complementarity characteristics on the performance of hybrid plants based on
  hydro and solar energies and show how the complementarity characteristics may
  be used to design hybrid power generation systems showing improved
  efficiency. The subsequent research work shall proceed to at least two
  different phases. In the first one, the method exposed in the present work
  shall be applied to real data and compared to the operation of existing hydro
  PV plants. In the second phase the obtained relations of the performance of
  the system to the different degrees of complementarity shall be confronted
  with design parameters of hydroelectric-photovoltaic plants based on
  complementary resources. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.%

  This paper describes a new approach to online forecasting of power production
  from PV systems. The method is suited to online forecasting in many
  applications and in this paper it is used to predict hourly values of solar
  power for horizons of up to 36 h. The data used is 15-min observations of
  solar power from 21 PV systems located on rooftops in a small village in
  Denmark. The suggested method is a two-stage method where first a statistical
  normalization of the solar power is obtained using a clear sky model. The
  clear sky model is found using statistical smoothing techniques. Then
  forecasts of the normalized solar power are calculated using adaptive linear
  time series models. Both autoregressive (AR) and AR with exogenous input
  (ARX) models are evaluated, where the latter takes numerical weather
  predictions (NWPs) as input. The results indicate that for forecasts up to 2
  h ahead the most important input is the available observations of solar
  power, while for longer horizons NWPs are the most important input. A root
  mean square error improvement of around 35{\%} is achieved by the ARX model
  compared to a proposed reference model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  Due to the rapidly growing photovoltaic (PV) market in Germany, solar
  electricity fed in the grid amounts already to a share of approx. 2{\%} of
  the total grid load during midday summertime. This is already a significant
  figure for grid operators. For several years a wind power prediction for wind
  energy is already available. But until now, there has been no operational
  solar electricity forecast. Therefore, the paper is aimed at providing an
  approach for a solar electricity forecast system based on the forecasts of
  the European center of midrange weather forecast ECMWF locally refined by
  model output statistics MOS with local weather stations. To evaluate the
  results, they have been compared with measured values of several thousand PV
  plants in Germany. The results show for daily values an RMSE of 24.5 {\%} for
  the months July and August 2006, which is of course a satisfying result.

  The interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological
  conditions are often ignored in favor of single-year data sets for modeling
  power generation and evaluating the economic value of photovoltaic (PV) power
  systems. Yet interannual variability significantly impacts the generation
  from one year to another of renewable power systems such as wind and PV.
  Consequently, the interannual variability of power generation corresponds to
  the interannual variability of capital returns on investment. The penetration
  of PV systems within the Hawaiian Electric Companies' portfolio has rapidly
  accelerated in recent years and is expected to continue to increase given the
  state's energy objectives laid out by the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. We
  use the National Solar Radiation Database (1998–2015) to characterize the
  interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological conditions
  across the State of Hawaii. These data sets are passed to the National
  Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisory Model (SAM) to calculate an
  18-year PV power generation data set to characterize the variability of PV
  power generation. We calculate the interannual coefficient of variability
  (COV) for annual average global horizontal irradiance (GHI) on the order of
  2{\%} and COV for annual capacity factor on the order of 3{\%} across the
  Hawaiian archipelago. Regarding the interannual variability of seasonal
  trends, we calculate the COV for monthly average GHI values on the order of
  5{\%} and COV for monthly capacity factor on the order of 10{\%}. We model
  residential-scale and utility-scale PV systems and calculate the economic
  returns of each system via the payback period and the net present value. We
  demonstrate that studies based on single-year data sets for economic
  evaluations reach conclusions that deviate from the true values realized by
  accounting for interannual variability.%

  We use reanalysis data to investigate the daily co-variability of wind and
  solar irradiance in Britain, and its implications for renewable energy supply
  balancing. The joint distribution of daily-mean wind speeds and irradiances
  shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to
  the rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with
  wind speed throughout the year (−0.4≲$\rho$≲−0.2): there is a weak
  tendency for windy days to be cloudier. This is particularly true in
  Atlantic-facing regions (western Scotland, south-west England). The east
  coast of Britain has the weakest anticorrelation, particularly in winter,
  primarily associated with a relative increase in the frequency of
  clear-but-windy days. We also consider the variability in total power output
  from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In all months,
  daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar
  capacity. The scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately
  70{\%}-solar to 30{\%}-wind. This work emphasises the importance of
  considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on
  long-term average relationships or correlations. In particular, the
  anticorrelation between wind and solar power in Britain cannot solely be
  relied upon to produce a well-balanced energy supply.%

  Employing a novel approach based on the timing of extreme precipitation

  A method for identifying clusters of points in a multi - dimensional
  Euclidean space is described and its application to taxonomy considered. It
  reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the
  spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the
  divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek et al. (l951a), is
  constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by
  applying the criterion of minimum within-cluster sum of squares. This
  procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits.
  The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly
  suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal
  indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a "variance
  ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The
  method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The
  results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by
  using the agglomerative method of Ward (1963) and the divisive method of
  Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).%

  We assess the impact of two sources of uncertainties in a limited area model
  (LAM) on the representation of intense precipitation: the size of the domain
  of integration and the use of the spectral nudging technique (driving of the
  large-scale within the domain of integration). We work in a perfect-model
  approach where the LAM is driven by a general circulation model (GCM) run at
  the same resolution and sharing the same physics and dynamics as the LAM. A
  set of three 50 km resolution simulations run over Western Europe with the
  LAM ALADIN-Climate and the GCM ARPEGE-Climate are performed to address this
  issue. Results are consistent with previous studies regarding the

  In the paper two models implemented to forecast the hourly solar irradiance
  with a day in advance are described. The models, based on Artificial Neural
  Networks (ANN), are generated by a master optimization process that defines
  the best number of neurons and selects a suitable ensemble of ANN. The two
  models consist of a Statistical (ST) model that uses only local measured data
  and a Model Output Statistics (MOS) that corrects Numerical Weather
  Prediction (NWP) data. ST and MOS are tested for the University of Rome
  “Tor Vergata” site. The models are trained and validated using one year
  data. Through a cross training procedure, the dependence of the models on the
  training year is also analyzed. The performance of ST, NWP and MOS models,
  together with the benchmark Persistence Model (PM), are compared. The ST
  model and the NWP model exhibit similar results. Nevertheless different
  sources of forecast errors between ST and NWP models are identified. The MOS
  model gives the best performance, improving the forecast of approximately
  29{\%} with respect to the PM.%

  The correlations of Hottel, Whillier, Liu and Jordan between diffuse and
  hemispherical, and between instantaneous (hourly) values and daily totals of
  solar radiation are recalibrated against pyrheliometer data for five stations
  in the U.S. The validity of the Liu and Jordan approach is confirmed, and
  numerical inaccuracies of the original correlations are found to arise from
  three factors: (i) reliance on uncorrected measurements of diffuse insolation
  with pyranometer plus shade ring, (ii) use of a single value of
  extraterrestrial insolation for a whole month, and (iii) neglect of seasonal
  variations in the diffuse/hemispherical ratio. The new correlation for the
  daily total ratio of diffuse over hemispherical insolation agrees with
  results reported for India, Israel and Canada which included the shade ring
  correction. This suggests that latitude independence is a good approximation.
  The new correlations imply that the diffuse component is significantly larger
  than that predicted by the original formulas of Liu and Jordan. Analytical
  expressions are presented the parameters of which are obtained by a least
  squares fit to the data. The resulting formulas provide a complete
  description of the long term average insolation incident on surfaces of
  arbitrary orientation; the only meteorological input is the long term average
  daily total of hemispherical insolation on the horizontal surface. Comparison
  between model and data shows an accuracy better than 3 per cent for the long
  term average insolation available to solar correctors, both fixed and
  tracking. The model provides a framework for optimal matching between solar
  radiation and ideal concentrators (based on the principle of phase space
  conservation). In addition to computing radiation availability for solar
  collectors, the model can be used for calculating heating and cooling loads
  of buildings. {\textcopyright} 1979.%

  Building large solar power plants requires significant long-term investment
  so understanding impacts from climate change will aid financial planning,
  technology selection, and energy output projections. In this article we
  examine how projected changes in temperature and insolation over the 21st
  century will affect photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP)
  output. Projected climate data was obtained from the coupled ocean-atmosphere
  climate models HadGEM1 and HadCM3 under the IPCC SRES A1B scenario which
  describes a future world of rapid economic growth with a balanced use of
  renewable and fossil fuel power generation. Our calculations indicate that
  under this scenario PV output from 2010 to 2080 is likely to increase by a
  few percent in Europe and China, see little change in Algeria and Australia,
  and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. CSP output is
  likely to increase by more than 10{\%} in Europe, increase by several percent
  in China and a few percent in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few
  percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. The results are robust to
  uncertainty in projected temperature change. A qualitative analysis of
  uncertainty in projected insolation change suggests strongest confidence in
  the results for Europe and least confidence in the results for western USA.
  Changes in PV and CSP output are further studied by calculating fractional
  contributions from changes in temperature and insolation. For PV there is
  considerable variation in contribution depending on location. For CSP the
  contribution from changes in insolation is always dominant.%

  The high temporal variability of solar power is a real issue to achieve a
  balanced production and consumption. Solar power forecasting is then
  necessary to better exploit this variability and to increase the penetration
  of photovoltaic power into the energy mix. Solar energy forecasting involves
  prediction of cloud property above a given point. For several hour ahead
  forecasts, using images from meteorological geostationary satellite is the
  most suitable solution. We propose a forecasting method based on a phase
  correlation algorithm for motion estimation between subsequent cloud maps
  derived from Meteosat-9 images. The method is assessed against
  state-of-the-art over a limited area over South of France for a 4-hour
  period. Cloud index maps are predicted. Our forecasting are 21 {\%} better
  than persistence in relative RMSE of cloud index. If state-of-the-art shows
  better results (23 {\%}), our algorithm reduces computing of 25 {\%} and then
  minimize operational solar forecasting constraints.%

  This study is an analysis of the seasonal all-sky surface solar radiation
  variability in Europe during 19702000 using surface observations from the
  Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA). On the basis of the annual means period
  19701985, there is a statistically significant decline of 3.0{\%} decade1
  (3.8 Wm2 decade1) followed by a nonsignificant rise of 0.3{\%} decade1 (0.4
  Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. The behavior of the solar radiation for spring
  is similar to the annual series and has the strongest increase of 1.6{\%}
  decade1 (2.5 Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. In summer a similar evolution to
  the annual and spring time series is shown but has a stronger decline of
  3.2{\%} decade1 (6.8 Wm2 decade1) during 19701985. A small positive
  nonsignificant trend is reported for the winter means time series while a
  statistically significant negative trend of 2.5{\%} decade1 (2.1 Wm2 decade1)
  was found in autumn during 19702000. By comparing variations in all-sky solar
  radiation with changes in cloud cover and NAO, we attribute the winter and
  autumn trends mainly to the NAO through the modification of mid-to-low cloud
  cover in southern Europe and the spring and summer trends to mid-to-low cloud
  cover in northern Europe. However, because the cloud cover and solar
  radiation relationship weakens in the low-frequency variability, it suggests
  that other effects such as aerosols may also play a role. In addition,
  aerosols could be interfering with the relationship between solar radiation
  and NAO, contributing to a strengthening of their correlation in the
  low-frequency variability during winter and autumn.%

  The complementarity of two renewable energy sources, namely hydro and wind,
  is investigated. We consider the diversification effect of wind power to
  reduce the risk of water inflow shortages, an important energy security
  concern for hydropower-based economic zones (e.g. Qu{\'{e}}bec and Norway).
  Our risk measure is based on the probability of a production deficit, in a
  manner akin to the value-at-risk, simulation analysis of financial
  portfolios. We examine whether the risk level of a mixed hydro-and-wind
  portfolio of generating assets improves on the risk of an all-hydro
  portfolio, by relaxing the dependence on water inflows and attenuating the
  impact of droughts. Copulas are used to model the dependence between the two
  sources of energy. The data considered, over the period 1958-2003, are for
  the province of Qu{\'{e}}bec, which possesses large hydro and wind resources.
  Our results indicate that for all scenarios considered, any proportion of
  wind up to 30{\%} improves the production deficit risk profile of an
  all-hydro system. We can also estimate the value, in TW h, of any additional
  one percent of wind in the portfolio. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

  Med-CORDEX simulations over the period 1979--2011 are evaluated with regard
  to their capability to represent observed decadal variations over the
  Euro-Mediterranean region and improve upon previous generation simulations
  from the ENSEMBLES project in their various experimental set-ups. Such an
  evaluation is needed to inform the use of these simulations and also future
  model development. For temperature, both Med-CORDEX and ENSEMBLES simulations
  tend to provide comparable results: they generally capture the sign and
  timing of the anomalies but not the amplitude. In general, no clear
  stratification appears when considering different types of Med-CORDEX
  regional modeling systems. Rather, it is remarkable that certain periods are
  poorly represented by all systems with a general underestimation of the
  observed long-term temperature trend, mostly in the summer season, even with
  respect to the corresponding global drivers. For precipitation, the
  Med-CORDEX simulations are closer to observations than the other datasets,
  with some improvement with respect to ENSEMBLES dataset. In general, all the
  systems experience difficulties in representing anomalies during specific
  periods or for specific regions. These appear in part due to limitations in
  the reanalysis boundary forcing data. For instance, in the second part of
  1980s, the spatial patterns of surface air temperature during DJF/MAM are
  generally poorly represented, as well as the regionally averaged MAM/JJA
  surface air temperature decadal anomalies. Overall, the evaluation suggests
  limited improvement in Med-CORDEX simulations compared to ENSEMBLES, and a
  lack of sensitivity to resolution or coupling configuration, with persisting
  problems in part likely related to the representation of surface processes
  that could also affect the viability of future projections (e.g. the
  estimation of temperature trends). A set of decadal variability evaluation
  metrics, as applied in this study, could be useful in the context of a
  broader evaluation framework.%

  Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for
  unsupervised dimension reduction. K-means clustering is a commonly used data
  clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks. Here we prove that
  principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster
  membership indicators for K-means clustering. New lower bounds for K-means
  objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the
  eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. These results indicate that
  unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning.
  Several implications are discussed. On dimension reduction, the result
  provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data
  reductions, beyond the conventional noisereduction explanation that PCA, via
  singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear
  approximation of the data. On learning, the result suggests effective
  techniques for K-means data clustering. DNA gene expression and Internet
  newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results. Experiments indicate that
  the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5 of the optimal values.%

  Integration of solar energy into the electricity network is becoming
  essential because of its continually increasing growth in usage. An efficient
  use of the fluctuating energy output of photovoltaic (PV) systems requires
  reliable forecast information. In fact, this integration can offer a better
  quality of service if the solar irradiance variation can be predicted with
  great accuracy. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods
  used to forecast solar irradiance in order to facilitate selection of the
  appropriate forecast method according to needs. The study starts with a
  presentation of statistical approaches and techniques based on cloud images.
  Next numerical weather prediction or NWP models are detailed before
  discussing hybrid models. Finally, we give indications for future solar

  Solar cell performance decreases with increasing temperature, fundamentally
  owing to increased internal carrier recombination rates, caused by increased
  carrier concentrations. The operating temperature plays a key role in the
  photovoltaic conversion process. Both the electrical efficiency and the power
  output of a photovoltaic (PV) module depend linearly on the operating
  temperature. The various correlations proposed in the literature represent
  simplified working equations which can be apply to PV modules or PV arrays
  mounted on free-standing frames, PV-Thermal collectors, and building
  integrated photovoltaic arrays, respectively. The electrical performance is
  primarily influenced by the material of PV used. Numerous correlations for
  cell temperature which have appeared in the literature involve basic
  environmental variables and numerical parameters which are material or system
  dependent. In this paper, a brief discussion is presented regarding the
  operating temperature of one-sun commercial grade silicon-based solar
  cells/modules and its effect upon the electrical performance of photovoltaic
  installations. Generally, the performance ratio decreases with latitude
  because of temperature. However, regions with high altitude have higher
  performance ratios due to low temperature, like, southern Andes, Himalaya
  region, and Antarctica. PV modules with less sensitivity to temperature are
  preferable for the high temperature regions and more responsive to
  temperature will be more effective in the low temperature regions. The
  geographical distribution of photovoltaic energy potential considering the
  effect of irradiation and ambient temperature on PV system performance is
  considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.%

  Australia has an abundant solar energy resource that is likely to be used for
  energy generation on a large scale. Variable sources of electricity
  generation require knowledge of the nature of their variability at all time
  scales. This study examines the effect that El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern
  Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have on solar radiation
  in Australia, in order to establish the role for seasonal forecasting of
  solar power. Calendar years are classified into their ENSO state using a sea
  surface temperature index. The ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis products are
  then used to estimate the effect of ENSO on global horizontal solar
  irradiance over the continent. A bootstrap technique is used to obtain
  confidence regions for the effect in both winter and summer. The main impact
  of ENSO occurs during winter over a large part of eastern Australia. Little
  impact was observed over the continent during summer. A similar analysis is
  conducted for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) to ensure that the observed ENSO
  effect is not a manifestation of the IOD. This study indicates that the ENSO
  phenomenon may account for solar energy changes of more than 10{\%} in some
  locations on a seasonal basis. We show that the solar radiation analysis is
  directly applicable to solar energy yield. Knowledge of this variability may
  influence the location of large solar generation plants. Also, there is a
  potential to predict solar energy a few months ahead by means of seasonal
  forecasting systems, which would help to assist with planning for electricity
  grid. {\textcopyright} 2011.%

  This study aims to assess the skill of regional climate models (RCMs) at
  reproducing the climatology of Mediterranean cyclones. Seven RCMs are
  considered, five of which were also coupled with an oceanic model. All
  simulations were forced at the lateral boundaries by the ERA-Interim
  reanalysis for a common 20-year period (1989--2008). Six different cyclone
  tracking methods have been applied to all twelve RCM simulations and to the
  ERA-Interim reanalysis in order to assess the RCMs from the perspective of
  different cyclone definitions. All RCMs reproduce the main areas of high
  cyclone occurrence in the region south of the Alps, in the Adriatic, Ionian
  and Aegean Seas, as well as in the areas close to Cyprus and to Atlas
  mountains. The RCMs tend to underestimate intense cyclone occurrences over
  the Mediterranean Sea and reproduce 24--40 {\{}{\%}{\}} of these systems, as
  identified in the reanalysis. The use of grid nudging in one of the RCMs is
  shown to be beneficial, reproducing about 60 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the intense
  cyclones and keeping a better track of the seasonal cycle of intense
  cyclogenesis. Finally, the most intense cyclones tend to be similarly
  reproduced in coupled and uncoupled model simulations, suggesting that
  modeling atmosphere--ocean coupled processes has only a weak impact on the
  climatology and intensity of Mediterranean cyclones.%

  Climate related energy sources such as wind, solar and runoff sources are
  variable in time and space, following their driving weather variables. High
  penetration of such energy sources might be facilitated by using their
  complementarity in order to increase the balance between energy load and
  generation. This study presents the analysis of the effect of a 100{\%}
  renewable energy mix composed by solar and run-of-the-river energy in
  Northern Italy where these two energy sources are the main alternative energy
  sources. Along a climate gradient from the Alpine crest (snow melt dominated
  area) to the Veneto plain (rainfall dominated area), solar power is generated
  in the flat plain, and run-of-the-river hydropower at two mountainous
  locations. Covering all possible mixes of these two sources, we analyze their
  complementarity across different temporal scales using two indicators: the
  standard deviation of the energy balance and the theoretical storage required
  for balancing generation and load. Results show that at small temporal scale
  (hourly), a high share of run-of-the-river power allows minimizing the energy
  balance variability. The opposite is obtained at larger temporal scales
  (daily and monthly) essentially because of lower variability of solar power
  generation, which also implies a lower storage requirement.%

  We have estimated the radiative impact produced by an unusually extreme dust
  and wildfire episode on the performance of a photovoltaic (PV) plant. The
  dust and wildfire events were mostly active on 26–28 and 29–30 June 2012,
  respectively. We took advantage of the consecutiveness of both events to
  separate and derive empirically the radiative effect of dust and smoke
  aerosols. With this purpose, we employed measurements of aerosol load,
  radiation and PV power output from a collocated atmospheric station and PV
  plant located at Burjassot (Valencia, Spain). The empirical estimates were
  obtained by direct comparison with a summer background day, happened right
  before the two consecutive case studies. The whole episode is characterized
  by high aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm, reaching values up to 1 and
  6 for dust and smoke, respectively. Our analysis shows an average daily
  energy loss of −132 kWh, that represents a fraction of 20{\%} of the
  energy generated by the PV plant on the reference summer background day. A
  significant fraction of the energy lost was due to smoke, with a daily
  maximum of 43{\%} and a daily average of 34{\%}. In case of dust, the energy
  reduction was moderated, with a daily average of 6{\%}. In terms of
  instantaneous power reduction, we have obtained peaks of 8 and 51{\%} for
  dust and smoke, respectively. The energy reduction due to aerosols is
  strongly dependent on AOD. Further, we have found that the power loss per
  unit of AOD at 870 nm is useful to separate the radiative impact of
  different aerosol types. Essentially, the efficiency of smoke to reduce the
  energy generated by the PV plant is much greater than that of dust. This
  effect is mainly due to the different optical properties in the near infrared
  that result in a daily Power Aerosol Forcing Efficiency at 870 nm of −5.7
  and −19.1 kW, for dust and smoke, respectively. Our results indicate that
  both the AOD and aerosol type drive the radiative impact of aerosols on the
  PV output, confirming that extreme aerosol events may drastically reduce the
  power generated by operative PV plants. This reduction may be as large as
  that reported for particle soiling. Therefore, considering both amount and
  type of aerosols in the PV power analyses is mandatory in order to obtain
  accurate forecast scenarios and improve the grid integration, especially
  during extreme episodes.%

  Medicanes are cyclones over the Mediterranean Sea having a tropical-like
  structure but a rather small size, that can produce significant damage due to
  the combination of intense winds and heavy precipitation. Future climate
  projections, performed generally with individual atmospheric climate models,
  indicate that the intensity of the medicanes could increase under climate
  change conditions. The availability of large ensembles of high resolution and
  ocean--atmosphere coupled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, performed
  in MedCORDEX and EURO-CORDEX projects, represents an opportunity to improve
  the assessment of the impact of climate change on medicanes. As a first step
  towards such an improved assessment, we analyze the ability of the RCMs used
  in these projects to reproduce the observed characteristics of medicanes, and
  the impact of increased resolution and air-sea coupling on their simulation.
  In these storms, air-sea interaction plays a fundamental role in their
  formation and intensification, a different mechanism from that of
  extra-tropical cyclones, where the baroclinic instability mechanism prevails.
  An observational database, based on satellite images combined with high
  resolution simulations (Miglietta et al. in Geophys Res Lett 40:2400--2405,
  2013), is used as a reference for evaluating the simulations. In general, the
  simulated medicanes do not coincide on a case-by-case basis with the observed
  medicanes. However, observed medicanes with a high intensity and relatively
  long duration of tropical characteristics are better replicated in
  simulations. The observed spatial distribution of medicanes is generally well
  simulated, while the monthly distribution reveals the difficulty of
  simulating the medicanes that first appear in September after the summer
  minimum in occurrence. Increasing the horizontal resolution has a systematic
  and generally positive impact on the frequency of simulated medicanes, while
  the general underestimation of their intensity is not corrected in most
  cases. The capacity of a few models to better simulate the medicane intensity
  suggests that the model formulation is more important than reducing the grid
  spacing alone. A negative intensity feedback is frequently the result of
  air-sea interaction for tropical cyclones in other basins. The introduction
  of air-sea coupling in the present simulations has an overall limited impact
  on medicane frequency and intensity, but it produces an interesting seasonal
  shift of the simulated medicanes from autumn to winter. This fact, together
  with the analysis of two contrasting particular cases, indicates that the
  negative feedback could be limited or even absent in certain situations. We
  suggest that the effects of air-sea interaction on medicanes may depend on
  the oceanic mixed layer depth, thus increasing the applicability of
  ocean--atmosphere coupled RCMs for climate change analysis of this kind of
  cyclones.%

  A Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI), is developed based on regional mean
  precipitation change, mean surface air temperature change, and change in

  change, or Hot-Spots. The RCCI is calculated for 26 land regions from the
  latest set of climate change projections by 20 global climate models for the
  A1B, A2 and B1 IPCC emission scenarios. The Mediterranean and North Eastern
  European regions emerge as the primary Hot-Spots, followed by high latitude
  northern hemisphere regions and by Central America, the most prominent
  tropical Hot-Spot. The main African Hot-Spots are Southern Equatorial Africa
  and the Sahara. Eastern North America is the prominent Hot-Spot over the

  magnitude of the RCCI, which is in fact greater than 0 for all regions.%

  We present a review of climate change projections over the Mediterranean
  region based on the most recent and comprehensive ensembles of global and
  regional climate change simulations completed as part of international
  collaborative projects. A robust and consistent picture of climate change
  over the Mediterranean emerges, consisting of a pronounced decrease in
  precipitation, especially in the warm season, except for the northern
  Mediterranean areas (e.g. the Alps) in winter. This drying is due to
  increased anticyclonic circulation that yields increasingly stable conditions
  and is associated with a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track. A
  pronounced warming is also projected, maximum in the summer season.
  Inter-annual variability is projected to mostly increase especially in
  summer, which, along with the mean warming, would lead to a greater
  occurrence of extremely high temperature events. The projections by the
  global and regional model simulations are generally consistent with each
  other at the broad scale. However, the precipitation change signal produced
  by the regional models shows substantial orographically-induced fine scale
  structure absent in the global models. Overall, these change signals are
  robust across forcing scenarios and future time periods, with the magnitude
  of the signal increasing with the intensity of the forcing. The intensity and
  robustness of the climate change signals produced by a range of global and
  regional climate models suggest that the Mediterranean might be an especially
  vulnerable region to global change.%

  The intrinsic performance of 18 broadband radiative models is assessed, using
  high-quality datasets from five sites in widely different climates. The
  selected models can predict direct, diffuse and global irradiances under
  clear skies from atmospheric data, and have all been (or still are) involved
  in large-scale applications, for instance to prepare solar resource maps and
  datasets, or to evaluate solar radiation in GIS software. The input data to
  the models include accurate aerosol and water vapor measurements by
  collocated sunphotometers, if needed. Cloud occurrences are meticulously
  scrutinized through the use of various tools to avoid cloud contamination of
  the test data. The intrinsic performance of the models is evaluated by
  comparison between their predictions and measurements at high frequency
  (1-minute time step at four sites, 3-minute at one site). The total expanded
  uncertainty of these measurements is estimated at 3{\%} for direct
  irradiance, and 5{\%} for diffuse and global irradiance.Various statistics
  are calculated to evaluate the systematic and random differences between the
  data series, as well as the agreement between the cumulative distribution
  functions. In the latter case, stringent statistics based on the
  Komolgorov-Smirnov (KS) test are used. Large differences in performance are
  apparent between models. Those that require more atmospheric inputs perform
  usually better than simpler models. Whereas many models can predict the
  global horizontal irradiance within uncertainty limits similar to those of
  the radiation measurements, the prediction of direct irradiance is less
  accurate. Moreover, the prediction of diffuse horizontal irradiance is
  particularly deficient in most models. The cumulative distribution functions
  also denote areas of concern.A ranking of all models is proposed, based on
  four statistical indicators: mean bias difference (MBD), root mean square
  difference (RMSD), total uncertainty with 95{\%} confidence limits (U 95),
  and the newly introduced Combined Performance Index (CPI), which optimally
  combines two KS indices with RMSD. For direct irradiance, consistently high
  rankings are obtained with five models (REST2, Ineichen, Hoyt, Bird, and
  Iqbal-C, in decreasing order of performance) that require a relatively large
  number of atmospheric inputs. The inferior performance of models requiring
  little or no atmospheric inputs suggests that large-scale solar resource
  products derived from them may be inappropriate for serious solar
  applications. Additionally, prediction uncertainties under ideal clear-sky
  conditions can propagate and affect all-sky predictions as well-resulting in
  potential biases in existing solar resource maps at the continent scale, for
  instance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.%

  {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Renewable energy resources are variable by
  nature. Due to this fact conventional electricity systems, which were
  designed for centralized generation, have to follow a different management
  approach when a big share of these technologies take part into the system.
  The space-time variability characteristics of solar radiation, wind and
  precipitation are very different and a detailed understanding of them is
  important for an adequate planning and management of the electricity system.
  This paper is focused on solar irradiation as source of energy for
  photovoltaic (PV) generation, but the proposed scheme can generally be
  applied to other renewable resources and different solar irradiation
  applications. A comprehensive methodology to analyze variability and
  complementarity of solar resource and PV production among sub-regions of a
  wide area is developed. The photovoltaic energy yield is defined as kWh per
  kW installed, which facilitates the comparison among sub-regions and allows a
  comparison with other renewable energies like solar thermoelectric or wind
  energy. The multi-step approach facilitates the spatial evaluation and
  comparison among areas and it could be applied to different time resolutions,
  from a short term analysis to climatological perspective as well as a climate
  change projections analysis. The main steps of the method are the application
  of an objective clustering method for performing a regionalization of the
  whole domain, the ana lysis of the temporal variability of solar radiation
  and photovoltaic energy yield, and the intercomparison of the obtained
  clusters for examining their complementarity. As an implementation example,
  we make use of 30 years of daily satellite data, which is usually considered
  as the time for defining a climatology, and a long-term overview of solar
  variability is analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). In this region, the
  internal interconnections of the electrical system are strong, but the
  external interconnections are rather limited. The spatial distribution and
  variability of photovoltaic (PV) power yield is calculated for different
  tracking systems. The variability is analyzed on an interannual time scale,
  which is relevant for energy supply security and year-to-year price
  stability. The interannual variability shows robustness and stability of
  solar radiation and PV production on average for the whole domain, but with
  significant differences among clusters that could allow spatial compensation
  of PV production. The relationship between the variability of solar
  irradiation and of PV yield is not uniform among the different clusters.
  Areas where solar irradiation is higher are more sensitive to tracking type.
  The whole process described in the article provides the information of how
  solar resource and the PV energy yield perform in a limited area and provide
  the tools to analyze the relationships between sub-areas and their
  variability. In this sense, this method can be applied for isolated or nearly
  isolated electric systems located in regions with a variety of climates, or
  for interconnected systems involving several countries.%

  Abstract Means and trends of shortwave irradiance at the earth's surface are
  calculated from pyranometer measurements stored in the Global Energy Balance

  set of shortwave irradiance monthly means. The relative random error of
  measurement is approximately 5{\%} of a monthly mean in general and
  approximately 2{\%} of a yearly mean. The shortwave irradiance yearly means
  are analyzed in a 2.5° × 2.5° grid. In average example grid cells in
  Europe (no large altitude differences, no coasts), the difference of
  shortwave irradiance yearly means measured at different stations (station
  effect) is less than 5{\%} of the cell mean, and the interannual variability
  is approximately 4{\%} of the cell mean. On most continents, shortwave
  irradiance decreases significantly in large regions, and significant positive
  trends are observed only in four small regions.%

  Wind energy is susceptible to global climate change because it could alter
  the wind patterns. Then, improvement of our knowledge of wind field
  variability is crucial to optimize the use of wind resources in a given
  region. Here, we quantify the effects of climate change on the surface wind
  speed field over the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands using an ensemble
  of four regional climate models driven by a global climate model. Regions of
  the Iberian Peninsula with coherent temporal variability in wind speed in
  each of the models are identified and analysed using cluster analysis. These
  regions are continuous in each model and exhibit a high degree of overlap
  across the models. The models forced by the European Reanalysis Interim
  (ERA-Interim) reanalysis are validated against the European Climate
  Assessment and Dataset wind. We find that regional models are able to
  simulate with reasonable skill the spatial distribution of wind speed at 10 m
  in the Iberian Peninsula, identifying areas with common wind variability.
  Under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B climate change
  scenario, the wind speed in the identified regions for 2031–2050 is up to
  5{\%} less than during the 1980–1999 control period for all models. The
  models also agree on the time evolution of spatially averaged wind speed in
  each region, showing a negative trend for all of them. These tendencies
  depend on the region and are significant at p = 5{\%} or slightly more for
  annual trends, while seasonal trends are not significant in most of the
  regions and seasons. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons,

  This study evaluates the Mediterranean Sea heat budget components from a set
  of forced and coupled simulations performed in the frame of the Med-CORDEX
  project. The simulations use regional climate system models (RCSMs) dedicated
  to the Mediterranean area and driven by the ERA40/ERA-Interim reanalyses. The
  study focuses on the period 1980--2010. Interannual variations of the average
  net heat flux at the sea surface are consistent among models but the spread
  in the mean values is large (from −4.8 to +2.2 Wm−2) with the coupled
  models showing the lowest heat loss from the sea. For the heat flux at the
  Strait of Gibraltar both interannual variations and mean values show a large
  intermodel spread. The basin average temperature shows positive trends with
  highest values in the coupled models; it also shows interannual variations
  that are in good agreement with observations. The heat content rate is
  calculated based on the derivative of the average temperature and is found to
  be significantly correlated for most models with the net heat flux at the sea
  surface (average correlation {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.5) but not
  with the net heat flux through the Strait of Gibraltar (average correlation
  {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.2), suggesting that in the considered
  RCSMs the interannual variability of the heat content rate is mainly driven
  by the surface heat fluxes. The resemblance between the simulated and
  observed heat content rates is stronger in the forced models than in the
  coupled ones. This is explained by the stronger constraint applied to the
  forced models by the use of the surface temperature relaxation to
  observations. The temperature of the outflowing water through the Strait of
  Gibraltar shows positive and significant trends, also higher in the coupled
  models. It is suggested that the Mediterranean Sea warming found in most
  models and in particular in the coupled ones, induces a change of the
  hydrographic conditions that affects the Strait of Gibraltar.%

  We present a European land-only daily high-resolution gridded data set for
  precipitation and minimum, maximum, and mean surface temperature for the
  period 1950–2006. This data set improves on previous products in its
  spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations,
  and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial
  interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered
  on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as
  well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in
  use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box
  averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We
  employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the
  monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using
  three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies
  using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an
  external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily
  estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily
  standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across
  the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number
  of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on
  the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal
  reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with
  return periods up to 10 years.%

  The concept and description of a remote sensing aerosol monitoring network
  initiated by NASA, developed to support NASA, CNES, and NASDA's Earth
  satellite systems under the name AERONET and expanded by national and
  international collaboration, is described. Recent development of
  weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable
  frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and
  precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements
  via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS' Data Collection Systems
  allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75{\%}
  of the Earth's surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage
  will increase to 90{\%} in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time
  processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the
  emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the
  project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open
  access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical
  interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for
  ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these
  measurements. The system's automatic data acquisition, transmission, and
  processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and
  global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies,
  radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals.
  This article discusses the operation and philosophy of the monitoring system,
  the precision and accuracy of the measuring radiometers, a brief description
  of the processing system, and access to the database.%

  This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate the maximum short-term
  output variability that an arbitrary fleet of PV systems places on any
  considered power grid. The paper begins with a model that demonstrates that
  the maximum possible variability for N identical, uncorrelated PV systems
  equals the total installed capacity divided by 2N. The paper then describes a
  general methodology that is applicable to arbitrary PV fleets. A key input to
  this generalized approach is the correlation, or absence thereof, existing
  between individual installations in the fleet at the considered variability
  time scale. In this respect, the article includes a presentation of new
  experimental evidence from hourly satellite-derived irradiances relating
  distance and fluctuation time scales in three geographic regions in the
  United States (Southwest, Southern Great Plains, and Hawaii) and from recent
  high density network measurements that both confirm and extend conclusions
  from previous studies, namely: (1) correlation coefficients decrease
  predictably with increasing distance, (2) correlation coefficients decrease
  at a similar rate when evaluated versus distance divided by the considered
  variability time scale, and (3) the accuracy of results is improved by
  including an implied cloud speed term.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  In Ontario (Canada), the integration of renewable power is a priority policy
  goal. Since 2004, the circumstances under which the integration of renewable
  power is evaluated have changed due to successive changes in price as well as
  concerns that its over-production may add to grid congestion. This research
  investigates the value of increasing complementarity (both proximate and
  geographically dispersed) of wind and solar resources as a means by which
  electricity planners and researchers might advance electricity sustainability
  in Ontario. More specifically, this paper asks the following questions: 1)
  Does the combination of solar and wind resources in selected locations in
  Ontario serve to ‘smooth out' power production, i.e., decrease instances of
  both high and low values, as compared to either resource producing
  individually? 2) Can this ‘smoothness' be further improved by dispersing
  these resources geographically amongst locations? and 3) Does increasing the
  number of locations with solar and wind resources further ‘smooth out'
  power production? Three years (2003–2005) of synchronous, hourly
  measurements of solar irradiance and wind speeds from Environment Canada's
  Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) are used to derive
  dimensionless indices for four locations in Ontario (Toronto, Wiarton, Sault
  Ste. Marie and Ottawa). These indices are used to develop three transparent
  and accessible methods of analysis: (1) graphical representation; (2)
  percentile ranking; and (3) using a theoretical maximum as a proxy for
  capacity. The article concludes that the combination of solar and wind within
  locations and amongst two locations improves ‘smoothness' in power
  production, as compared to when each resource is produced on its own;
  moreover, it is further improved once more than two resources and two
  locations are combined. However, there is neither further benefit, nor
  drawback, associated with the geographic dispersion of complementarity
  between solar in one location and wind in another, when compared to both
  resources in one location.%

  The higher penetration of renewable resources in the energy portfolios of
  several communities accentuates the need for accurate forecasting of variable
  resources (solar, wind, tidal) at several different temporal scales in order
  to achieve power grid balance. Solar generation technologies have experienced
  strong energy market growth in the past few years, with corresponding
  increase in local grid penetration rates. As is the case with wind, the solar
  resource at the ground level is highly variable mostly due to cloud cover
  variability, atmospheric aerosol levels, and indirectly and to a lesser
  extent, participating gases in the atmosphere. The inherent variability of
  solar generation at higher grid penetration levels poses problems associated
  with the cost of reserves, dispatchable and ancillary generation, and grid
  reliability in general. As a result, high accuracy forecast systems are
  required for multiple time horizons that are associated with regulation,
  dispatching, scheduling and unit commitment. Here we review the theory behind
  these forecasting methodologies, and a number of successful applications of
  solar forecasting methods for both the solar resource and the power output of
  solar plants at the utility scale level.%

  This study addresses the task of identifying optimum locations for solar and
  wind power plants so that the wind-plussolar power generation meets certain
  conditions of efficiency and stability, thus allowing to overcome the
  downside that the natural variability of these renewable resources
  represents. The method was based on a simulated annealing algorithm and
  applied over the Iberian Peninsula, a region whose commitment to renewable

  Europe is investing considerably in renewable energies for a sustainable
  future, with both Iberian countries (Portugal and Spain) promoting
  significantly new hydropower, wind, and solar plants. The climate variability
  in this area is highly controlled by just a few large-scale teleconnection
  modes. However, the relationship between these modes and the renewable
  climate-dependent energy resources has not yet been established in detail.
  The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the North Atlantic
  Oscillation (NAO) on the interannual variability of the main and primary
  renewable energy resources in Iberia. This is achieved through a holistic
  assessment that is based on a 10-km-resolution climate simulation spanning
  the period 1959–2007 that provides physically consistent data of the
  various magnitudes involved. A monthly analysis for the ex- tended winter
  (October–March) months shows that negativeNAOphases enhance wind speeds
  (10{\%}–15{\%}) and, thereby, wind power (estimated around 30{\%} at
  typical wind-turbine altitudes) and hydropower re- sources (with changes in
  precipitation exceeding 100{\%} and implying prolonged responses in reservoir
  storage and release throughout the year), while diminishing the solar
  potential (10{\%}–20{\%}). Opposite signals were also sporadically
  identified, being well explained when taking into account the orography and
  the prevailing wind direction during bothNAOphases.Anadditional analysis
  using real wind, hydropower, and solar power generation data further confirms
  the strong signature of the NAO.%

  Renewable energies arise as part of both economic development plans and
  mitigation strategies aimed at abating climate change. Contrariwise, most
  renewable energies are potentially vulnerable to climate change, which could
  affect in particular solar and wind power. Proper evaluations of this two-way
  climate-renewable energy relationship require detailed information of the
  geographical location of the renewable energy fleets. However, this
  information is usually provided as total amounts installed per administrative
  region, especially with respect to future planned installations. To help
  overcome this limiting issue, the objective of this contribution was to
  develop the so-called CLIMIX model: a tool that performs a realistic spatial
  allocation of given amounts of both photovoltaic (PV) and wind power
  installed capacities and evaluates the energy generated under varying climate
  conditions. This is done over a regular grid so that the created scenarios
  can be directly used in conjunction with outputs of climate models. First, we
  used the 0.44° resolution grid defined for the EURO-CORDEX project and
  applied the CLIMIX model to spatially allocate total amounts of both
  unreported 2012 and future 2020 PV and wind power installations in Europe at
  the country level. Second, we performed a validation exercise using the
  various options for estimating PV and wind power production under the created
  scenarios that are included in the model. The results revealed an acceptable
  agreement between the estimated and the recorded power production values in
  every European country. Lastly, we estimated increases in power production
  derived from the future deployment of new renewable units, often obtaining
  non-direct relationships. This latter further emphasizes the need of accurate
  spatially-resolved PV and wind power scenarios in order to perform reliable
  estimations of power production.%

  Ambitious climate change mitigation plans call for a significant increase in
  the use of renewables, which could, however, make the supply system more
  vulnerable to climate variability and changes. Here we evaluate climate
  change impacts on solar photovoltaic (PV) power in Europe using the recent
  EURO-CORDEX ensemble of high-resolution climate projections together with a
  PV power production model and assuming a well-developed European PV power
  fleet. Results indicate that the alteration of solar PV supply by the end of
  this century compared with the estimations made under current climate
  conditions should be in the range (-14{\%};+2{\%}), with the largest
  decreases in Northern countries. Temporal stability of power generation does
  not appear as strongly affected in future climate scenarios either, even
  showing a slight positive trend in Southern countries. Therefore, despite
  small decreases in production expected in some parts of Europe, climate
  change is unlikely to threaten the European PV sector.%

  The analysis of the influence of future climatic variations on air quality
  needs of methods that give a space-time display of large atmospheric data
  related to air pollution. Here a new approach in order to assess the impacts
  of climate change on the patterns of variation of secondary inorganic
  aerosols (SIA) over Europe is presented. The most widely used method of
  analysis (selected time-slices, future-minus-present method) is very
  sensitive to the chosen control and future periods because of the internal
  variability of the climate system. In order to overcome this limitation, full
  transient simulations for the period 1991-2100 under the SRES A2 scenario are
  analysed by the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) methodology in order
  minimise the uncertainty associated to the internal variability due to the
  longer time series obtained. The results indicate that the EOF1 accounts for
  around 30-45{\%} of the total variance for the SIA levels and points out a
  general increase of its trend over the entire domain (p{\textless} 0.005),
  except in the case of nitrate, whose change signal is not significant
  (p{\textgreater} 0.1). The correlation between SIA and meteorological
  parameters indicates that the trends and patterns of variation of aerosols
  are related to the higher temperature projected for the future climate. It
  favours the formation of sulphates and ammonium (increasing the
  concentrations of atmospheric oxidants) and the decomposition of ammonium
  nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the decreases in precipitation
  have a strong effect on the frequency of the washout and therefore in the
  levels of aerosols. The concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing
  precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. The trend
  from a decreasing mixing height found in several areas of Europe is
  frequently related to a decrease in precipitation, representing an adding
  effect for the enhanced future SIA concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2010

  Time-scale and extent at which large-scale circulation modes determine the

  Lett. 8 044035 Abstract The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East
  Atlantic (EA) and the Scandinavian (SCAND) modes are the three main
  large-scale circulation patterns driving the climate variability of the
  Iberian Peninsula. This study assesses their influence in terms of solar
  (photovoltaic) and wind power generation potential (SP and WP) and evaluates
  their skill as predictors. For that we use a hindcast regional climate
  simulation to retrieve the primary meteorological variables involved, surface
  solar radiation and wind speed. First we identify that the maximum influence
  of the various modes occurs on the interannual variations of the monthly mean
  SP and WP series, being generally more relevant in winter. Second we find
  that in this time-scale and season, SP (WP) varies up to 30{\%} (40{\%}) with
  respect to the mean climatology between years with opposite phases of the
  modes, although the strength and the spatial distribution of the signals
  differ from one month to another. Last, the skill of a multi-linear
  regression model (MLRM), built using the NAO, EA and SCAND indices, to
  reconstruct the original wintertime monthly series of SP and WP was
  investigated. The reconstructed series (when the MLRM is calibrated for each
  month individually) correlate with the original ones up to 0.8 at the
  interannual time-scale. Besides, when the modeled series for each individual
  month are merged to construct an October-to-March monthly series, and after
  removing the annual cycle in order to account for monthly anomalies, these
  correlate 0.65 (0.55) with the original SP (WP) series in average. These
  values remain fairly stable when the calibration and reconstruction periods
  differ, thus supporting up to a point the predictive potential of the method
  at the time-scale assessed here.%

  Ten-year (1964–1973) continuous records at Hamburg of hourly sums of solar
  and terrestrial, downward and upward radiation flux densities have been
  evaluated with regard to simultaneous hourly cloud observations. The
  irradiance at given solar elevation is plotted vs total cloud amount for each
  season and for the whole year; in the same way, the ratio of the irradiance
  under clouded to that under cloudless sky is presented. Additional diagrams
  show the irradiance under cloudless and under overcast sky as function of
  solar elevation. The ratio of global radiation at total cloud amount N okta,
  G(N), to global radiation at cloudless sky, G(0), at the same solar elevation
  $\gamma$ turned out to be indepenent of $\gamma$ and can be parameterized by
  G(N)G(0) = 1 − 0.75(N8)3.4. The influence of cloud type is demonstrated by
  diagrams showing the irradiance under skies overcast by a specific cloud type
  as function of solar elevation for each season and for the year; also, the
  corresponding ratios “overcast” to “cloudless” are presented. In the

  The Earth?s radiation budget is essential for driving the general circulation
  of the atmosphere and ocean, and for building the main conditions for the
  Earth's climate system. To detect changes in the Earth?s surface radiation
  field the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and its central archive -
  the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) - was created in 1992. BSRN is a
  project of the Radiation Panel (now the Data and Assessment Panel) from the
  Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) under the umbrella of the
  World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). It is the global baseline network
  for surface radiation for the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS),
  contributing to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW), and forming a cooperative
  network with the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change
  (NDACC). The data are of primary importance in supporting the validation and
  confirmation of satellite and computer model estimates. At a relatively small
  number of stations (currently 58) in contrasting climatic zones, solar and
  atmospheric radiation is measured with instruments of the highest available
  accuracy and with high temporal resolution (mainly 1 minute). A total of
  about 7000 station-month datasets were available in the WRMC in mid 2013. All
  data are interactively accessible to external users for bona fide research
  purposes at no cost. This report provides information for scientists
  interested in high quality surface radiation data as well as for scientists
  running a BSRN station. It offers information about the available data, the
  data access and describes tools to visualize the data and to check their
  quality.%

  Although now over 100 years old, the classification$\backslash$nof climate
  originally formulated by Wladimir K¨oppen$\backslash$nand modified by his

  widely used in teaching school and$\backslash$nundergraduate courses on
  climate. It is also still in regular$\backslash$nuse by researchers across a

  variables and for assessing the$\backslash$noutput of global climate models.
  Here we have produced a$\backslash$nnew global map of climate using the
  K¨oppen-Geiger system$\backslash$nbased on a large global data set of
  long-term monthly precipitation$\backslash$nand temperature station time

  were calculated at$\backslash$neach station and interpolated between stations
  using a twodimensional$\backslash$n(latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline

  discuss$\backslash$nsome problems in dealing with sites that are not
  uniquely$\backslash$nclassified into one climate type by the K¨oppen-Geiger

  Key global energy, environmental and sustainability targets are closely
  related to the development of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). This includes
  reduction of Greenhouse Gas emissions and safe energy provision in a
  sustainable manner. The integration of RES in the energy mix needs to
  overcome the technical challenges that are related to grid's operation.
  Therefore, there is an increasing need to explore approaches where different
  RES will operate under a synergetic approach. A straightforward way to
  achieve that is by optimizing the complementarity among RES systems both over
  time and spatially. The present article developed a methodology that examines
  the degree of time complementarity between small hydropower stations (SHPS)
  and adjacent solar PV systems (SPVS). The methodology builds on an
  optimization algorithm that associates hydrological with solar irradiation
  information. In particularly, the algorithm examines possible alterations on
  the PV system installation (azimuth, tilt) that increase the complementarity,
  with minor compromises in the total solar energy output. The methodology has
  been tested in a case study and the outcome indicated that a compromise of
  10{\%} in the solar energy output (90{\%} threshold) may result in a
  significant increase of the complementarity (66.4{\%}).%

  Anthropogenic aerosols are intricately linked to the climate system and to
  the hydrologic cycle. The net effect of aerosols is to cool the climate
  system by reflecting sunlight. Depending on their composition, aerosols can
  also absorb sunlight in the atmosphere, further cooling the surface but
  warming the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on the
  temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation
  nuclei, impact the hydrologic cycle, through changes in cloud cover, cloud
  properties and precipitation. Unravelling these feedbacks is particularly
  difficult because aerosols take a multitude of shapes and forms, ranging from
  desert dust to urban pollution, and because aerosol concentrations vary
  strongly over time and space. To accurately study aerosol distribution and
  composition therefore requires continuous observations from satellites,
  networks of ground-based instruments and dedicated field experiments.
  Increases in aerosol concentration and changes in their composition, driven
  by industrialization and an expanding population, may adversely affect the
  Earth's climate and water supply.%

  intensity of diffuse radiation on clear days, the long term average hourly
  and daily sums of diffuse radiation, and the daily sums of diffuse radiation
  for various categories of days of differing degrees of cloudiness. For these
  determinations, it is necessary to have, either from actual measurements or
  estimates, a knowledge of the total (direct plus diffuse) radiation on a
  horizontal surface-its measurement is now regularly made at 98 localities in
  the United States and Canada. For localities where only an estimate of the

  The contribution of power production from PV systems to the electricity
  supply is constantly increasing. An efficient use of the fluctuating solar
  power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the
  expected power production, as a basis for management of the electricity grids
  and trading on the energy market. We present and evaluate the regional PV
  power prediction system of University of Oldenburg and Meteocontrol GmbH
  providing forecasts of up to 2 days ahead with hourly resolution. The
  proposed approach is based on forecasts of the global model of the European
  Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF). It includes a post-processing
  procedure to derive optimised, site-specific irradiance forecasts and
  explicit physical modelling steps to convert the predicted irradiances to PV
  power. Finally, regional power forecasts are derived by up-scaling from a
  representative set of PV systems. The investigation of proper up-scaling is a
  special focus of this paper. We introduce a modified up-scaling approach,
  modelling the spatial distribution of the nominal power with a resolution of
  18?18. The operational PV power prediction system is evaluated in comparison
  to the modified up-scaling approach for the control areas of the two German
  transmission system operators ‘transpower' and ‘50 Hertz' for the period
  2.7.2009–30.4.2010. rmse values of the operational forecasts are in the
  range of 4–5{\%} with respect to the nominal power for intra-day and
  day-ahead forecast horizons. Further improvement is achieved with the
  modified up- scaling approach. Copyright {\#} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons,

  The paper reviews different approaches, technologies, and strategies to
  manage large-scale schemes of variable renewable electricity such as solar
  and wind power. We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition
  to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to
  renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range
  from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more
  advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked
  approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity,
  but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new
  solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may
  restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different "P2Y"-type of
  strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy
  form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal
  energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential
  flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To
  "functionalize" or to assess the value of the various energy system
  flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy
  market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing
  large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be
  promising.%

  {\textless}p{\textgreater}The Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment
  (ChArMEx; {\textless}a href="http://charmex.lsce.ipsl.fr"
  target="{\_}blank"{\textgreater}http://charmex.lsce.ipsl.fr{\textless}/a{\textgreater})
  is a collaborative research program federating international activities to
  investigate Mediterranean regional chemistry-climate interactions. A special
  observing period (SOP-1a) including intensive airborne measurements was
  performed in the framework of the Aerosol Direct Radiative Impact on the
  regional climate in the MEDiterranean region (ADRIMED) project during the
  Mediterranean dry season over the western and central Mediterranean basins,
  with a focus on aerosol-radiation measurements and their modeling. The SOP-1a
  took place from 11 June to 5 July 2013. Airborne measurements were made by
  both the ATR-42 and F-20 French research aircraft operated from Sardinia
  (Italy) and instrumented for in situ and remote-sensing measurements,
  respectively, and by sounding and drifting balloons, launched in Minorca. The
  experimental setup also involved several ground-based measurement sites on
  islands including two ground-based reference stations in Corsica and
  Lampedusa and secondary monitoring sites in Minorca and Sicily. Additional
  measurements including lidar profiling were also performed on alert during
  aircraft operations at EARLINET/ACTRIS stations at Granada and Barcelona in
  Spain, and in southern Italy. Remote-sensing aerosol products from satellites
  (MSG/SEVIRI, MODIS) and from the AERONET/PHOTONS network were also used.
  Dedicated meso-scale and regional modeling experiments were performed in
  relation to this observational effort. We provide here an overview of the
  different surface and aircraft observations deployed during the
  ChArMEx/ADRIMED period and of associated modeling studies together with an
  analysis of the synoptic conditions that determined the aerosol emission and
  transport. Meteorological conditions observed during this campaign (moderate
  temperatures and southern flows) were not favorable to producing high levels
  of atmospheric pollutants or intense biomass burning events in the region.
  However, numerous mineral dust plumes were observed during the campaign, with
  the main sources located in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, leading to aerosol
  optical depth (AOD) values ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 (at 440 nm) over the
  western and central Mediterranean basins. One important point of this
  experiment concerns the direct observations of aerosol extinction onboard the
  ATR-42, using the CAPS system, showing local maxima reaching up to 150 M
  m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} within the
  dust plume. Non-negligible aerosol extinction (about 50 M
  m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) has also been
  observed within the marine boundary layer (MBL). By combining the ATR-42
  extinction coefficient observations with absorption and scattering
  measurements, we performed a complete optical closure revealing excellent
  agreement with estimated optical properties. This additional information on
  extinction properties has allowed calculation of the dust single scattering
  albedo (SSA) with a high level of confidence over the western Mediterranean.
  Our results show a moderate variability from 0.90 to 1.00 (at 530 nm) for
  all flights studied compared to that reported in the literature on this
  optical parameter. Our results underline also a relatively low difference in
  SSA with values derived near dust sources. In parallel, active remote-sensing
  observations from the surface and onboard the F-20 aircraft suggest a complex
  vertical structure of particles and distinct aerosol layers with sea spray
  and pollution located within the MBL, and mineral dust and/or aged North
  American smoke particles located above (up to 6–7 km in altitude).
  Aircraft and balloon-borne observations allow one to investigate the vertical
  structure of the aerosol size distribution showing particles characterized by
  a large size ({\&}gt; 10 µm in diameter) within dust plumes. In most of
  cases, a coarse mode characterized by an effective diameter ranging between 5
  and 10 µm, has been detected above the MBL. In terms of shortwave (SW)
  direct forcing, in situ surface and aircraft observations have been merged
  and used as inputs in 1-D radiative transfer codes for calculating the
  aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF). Results show significant surface SW
  instantaneous forcing (up to −90 W
  m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at noon).
  Aircraft observations provide also original estimates of the vertical
  structure of SW and LW radiative heating revealing significant instantaneous
  values of about 5° K per day in the solar spectrum (for a solar angle of
  30°) within the dust layer. Associated 3-D modeling studies from regional
  climate (RCM) and chemistry transport (CTM) models indicate a relatively good
  agreement for simulated AOD compared with observations from the
  AERONET/PHOTONS network and satellite data, especially for long-range dust
  transport. Calculations of the 3-D SW (clear-sky) surface DRF indicate an
  average of about −10 to −20 W
  m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (for the whole
  period) over the Mediterranean Sea together with maxima (−50 W
  m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) over northern
  Africa. The top of the atmosphere (TOA) DRF is shown to be highly variable
  within the domain, due to moderate absorbing properties of dust and changes
  in the surface albedo. Indeed, 3-D simulations indicate negative forcing over
  the Mediterranean Sea and Europe and positive forcing over northern Africa.
  Finally, a multi-year simulation, performed for the 2003 to 2009 period and
  including an ocean–atmosphere (O–A) coupling, underlines the impact of
  the aerosol direct radiative forcing on the sea surface temperature, O–A
  fluxes and the hydrological cycle over the
  Mediterranean.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}%

  A power conversion efficiency record of 10.1{\%} was achieved for kesterite
  absorbers, using a Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)4 thin-film solar cell made by
  hydrazine-based solution processing. Key device characteristics were
  compiled, including light/dark J–V, quantum efficiency, temperature
  dependence of Voc and series resistance, photoluminescence, and capacitance
  spectroscopy, providing important insight into how the devices compare with
  high-performance Cu(In,Ga)Se2. The record kesterite device was shown to be
  primarily limited by interface recombination, minority carrier lifetime, and

  Photovoltaic (PV) modules in real operation present angular losses in
  reference to their behaviour in standard test conditions, due to the angle of
  incidence of the incident radiation and the surface soil. Although these
  losses are not always negligible, they are commonly not taken into account
  when correcting the electrical characteristics of the PV module or estimating
  the energy production of PV systems. The main reason of this approximation is
  the lack of easy-to-use mathematical expressions for the angular losses
  calculation. This paper analyses these losses on PV modules and presents an
  analytical model based on theoretical and experimental results. The proposed
  model fits monocrystalline as well as polycrystalline and amorphous silicon
  PV modules, and contemplates the existence of superficial dust. With it
  angular losses integrated over time periods of interest can be easily
  calculated. Monthly and annual losses have been calculated for 10 different
  European sites, having diverse climates and latitudes (ranging from 32?? to
  52??), and considering different module tilt angles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science

  Abstract The contribution of clouds and aerosols to the decadal variations of
  downward surface shortwave radiation (SSR) is a current controversial topic.
  This study proposes a method, which is based on surface-based SSR
  measurements, aerosol observations, and radiative transfer simulations (in
  cloud-free and cloud- and aerosol-free scenarios), to evaluate cloud-aerosol
  (CARE), cloud (CRE), and aerosol (ARE) radiative effects. This method is
  applied to quantify the role played by, separately, clouds and aerosols on
  the intense brightening of the SSR observed in the Iberian Peninsula. Clouds
  and Earth's Radiation Energy Budget System (CERES) and surface-based data
  exhibit an increase in SSR between 2003 and 2012, exceeding +10 W m−2
  over this period for some areas of the peninsula. The calculations are
  performed for three surface-based sites: Barcelona and Valladolid (Spain),
  and Évora (Portugal). Ranges in monthly values of CARE, CRE, and ARE are
  (−80, −20), (−60, −20), and (−30, 0), respectively (in W m−2).
  The average trends for the analyzed period of CARE, CRE, and ARE are +7, +5,
  and +2 W m−2 per decade, respectively. Overall, three fourths of the SSR
  trend is explained by clouds, while the other one fourth is related to
  aerosol changes. The SSR trends explained by the clouds and aerosol radiative
  effects are in line with the observed reductions in total cloud cover and
  aerosol load (both at the surface and in the whole atmospheric column).
  Furthermore, the CRE values are compared against CERES data showing good
  agreement between both data series, although some discrepancies are observed
  in their trends.%

  Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming useful as alternate
  approaches to conventional techniques or as components of integrated systems.
  They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas
  and are becoming more popular nowadays. They can learn from examples, are
  fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete
  data, are able to deal with nonlinear problems and once trained can perform
  prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being
  developed and deployed worldwide in a wide variety of applications, mainly
  because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation
  capabilities. AI has been used in different sectors, such as engineering,
  economics, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for
  modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting and control
  of complex systems. The paper outlines an understanding of how AI systems
  operate by way of presenting a number of problems in photovoltaic systems
  application. Problems presented include three areas: forecasting and modeling
  of meteorological data, sizing of photovoltaic systems and modeling,
  simulation and control of photovoltaic systems. Published literature
  presented in this paper show the potential of AI as design tool in
  photovoltaic systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  Wind and solar energy are expected to play a major role in the current decade
  to help Europe reaching the renewable energy penetration targets fixed by
  Directive 2009/28/EC. However, it is difficult to predict the actual
  production profiles of wind and solar energy as they depend heavily on
  variable meteorological features of solar radiation and wind speed. In an
  ideal system, wind and solar electricity are both injected in a fast reacting
  grid instantaneously matching supply and demand. In such a system wind and
  solar electricity production profiles should complement each other as much as
  possible in order to minimise the need of storage and additional capacity. In
  the present paper the complementarity of wind and solar resources is assessed
  for a test year in Italy.To achieve this goal we employ data at high spatial
  and temporal resolution data for both solar radiation and wind speed in Italy
  obtained from running two state of the art models (PVGIS and MINNI). Hourly
  profiles for solar and wind energy produced are compared in each 4×4km2 grid
  cell in Italy for 2005, and hourly, daily and monthly correlation
  coefficients are computed in order to assess the local complementarity of the
  two resources. A Monte Carlo approach is also developed to estimate how
  large-scale wind and solar energy productions could be potentially involved
  to complement each other in a scenario with up to 100 production sites across
  Italy. The results show how local complementarity can be very interesting
  with monthly correlation coefficients reaching values lower than-0.8 in
  several areas. Large-scale complementarity is also relevant with nation-wide
  monthly correlation coefficients showing values between-0.65 and-0.6. These
  model results indicate that in this sample year of 2005, wind and solar
  energy potential production have shown complementary time behaviour
  complementary, favourably supporting their integration in the energy system.

  This work describes a new hybrid method that combines information from
  processed satellite images with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for
  predicting global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at temporal horizons of 30, 60,
  90, and 120min. The forecast model is applied to GHI data gathered from two
  distinct locations (Davis and Merced) that represent well the geographical
  distribution of solar irradiance in the San Joaquin Valley. The forecasting
  approach uses information gathered from satellite image analysis including
  velocimetry and cloud indexing as inputs to the ANN models. To the knowledge
  of the authors, this is the first attempt to hybridize stochastic learning
  and image processing approaches for solar irradiance forecasting. We compare
  the hybrid approaches using standard error metrics to quantify the
  forecasting skill for the several time horizons considered.%

  The environmental and economical merits of converting solar energy into
  electricity via photovoltaic cells have caused an ever increasing interest
  among developed and developing countries to allocate more budget on
  photovoltaic systems in order to boost up their efficiency in recent years.
  Besides the material and design parameters, there are several omnipresent
  factors such as dust, humidity and air velocity that can influence the PV
  cell's performance. There have been a handful of studies conducted on the
  effect of various influential parameters on the efficiency and performance of
  photovoltaic cells; however none has taken all these three parameters into
  account simultaneously. In this study the impact of dust accumulation,
  humidity level and the air velocity will be elaborated separately and finally
  the impact of each on the other will be clarified. It is shown that each of
  these three factors affect the other two and it is concluded that in order to
  have a profound insight of solar cell design, the effect of these factors
  should be taken into consideration in parallel. {\textcopyright} 2012

  Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to retrieve the
  aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In parallel, AOD
  climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also
  available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol
  types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of
  this unique multiyear database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment
  by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, seasalt, sulfate, black and
  organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products:
  NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS,
  ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical
  datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth-Probe) and
  METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from
  Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4,
  the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS
  and MACC. Ground-based Level- 2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations
  around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The
  sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this
  region, showing a relevant spatiotemporal variability and highlighting high
  dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate
  aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows
  limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard
  products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the
  basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to
  underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to
  MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical
  dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study
  confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a
  large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are
  confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D
  blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time
  series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the
  Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the
  2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from
  AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC
  reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations,
  which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology.We extend the
  2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the
  2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate
  aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the
  Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties
  of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie
  calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate
  models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosolclimate studies.%

  Since the 1980s anthropogenic aerosols have been considerably reduced in
  Europe and the Mediterranean area. This decrease is often considered as the
  likely cause of the brightening effect observed over the same period. This
  phenomenon is however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate
  models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled
  regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain
  81 ± 16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the
  surface warming simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct
  aerosol effect is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated
  brightening. The comparison between regional simulations and homogenized
  ground-based observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as
  well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the
  Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the
  realistic aerosol variations.%

  Photovoltaic (PV) energy is one option to serve the rising global energy need
  with low environmental impact. PV is of particular interest for local energy
  solutions in developing countries prone to high solar insolation. In order to
  assess the PV potential of prospective sites, combining knowledge of the
  atmospheric state modulating solar radiation and the PV performance is
  necessary. The present study discusses the PV power as function of
  atmospheric aerosols in the Sahel zone for clear-sky-days. Daily yields for a
  polycrystalline silicon PV module are reduced by up to 48 {\%} depending on

  We examine multidecadal changes in surface downward shortwave (SW) radiation
  flux, total cloud cover, SW cloud effect, and related parameters over Europe
  during 1965{\&}{\#}8211;2004 using monthly gridded data from the Global
  Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), synoptic cloud reports, and the International
  Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). One key issue is distinguishing
  the effects of natural cloud variability from long-term anthropogenic aerosol
  influences on surface SW flux. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of cloud
  cover radiative effect (CCRE), defined as the change in downward SW flux
  produced by a change in cloud cover. The correlation between pan-European
  time series of CCRE anomalies and GEBA solar radiation anomalies is 0.88,
  indicating that cloud cover variability and associated changes in cloud
  albedo dominate SW radiation variability on monthly to decadal timescales.
  After these weather-related cloud effects are removed by subtracting CCRE
  anomalies from GEBA solar radiation anomalies via linear regression, a
  distinct decreasing trend followed by a distinct increasing trend remain in
  the residual time series. Depending on the method of trend calculation,
  pan-European residual flux declined by a statistically significant
  2.7{\&}{\#}8211;3.5 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2 per decade during 1971{\&}{\#}8211;1986
  and rose by a statistically significant 2.0{\&}{\#}8211;2.3 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2
  per decade during 1987{\&}{\#}8211;2002. The fact that independent grid boxes
  exhibit mostly negative trends in the earlier period and mostly positive
  trends in the later period demonstrates that these long-term variations in SW
  flux are real and widespread over Europe. Changes in cloud cover cannot
  account for the trends in surface SW flux since cloud cover actually slightly
  decreased during 1971{\&}{\#}8211;1986 and slightly increased during
  1987{\&}{\#}8211;2002. The most likely explanation is changes in
  anthropogenic aerosol emissions that led to more scattering and absorption of
  SW radiation during the earlier period of solar
  {\&}{\#}8220;dimming{\&}{\#}8221; and less scattering and absorption during
  the later period of solar {\&}{\#}8220;brightening.{\&}{\#}8221;%

  To support climate research, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)
  initiated a new radiometric network, the Baseline Surface Radiation Network
  (BSRN). The network aims at providing validation material for satellite radi-
  ometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term variations
  in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play an
  important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are
  designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required
  to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long
  period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these
  goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and
  the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all
  stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics
  (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored
  at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center
  (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at
  stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be
  stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred
  to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN,
  consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S,
  and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to
  scientific communities in vari- ous ways depending on the communication
  environment of the users. The present article discusses the scientific base,
  organizational and technical aspects of the network, and data retrieval
  methods; shows various application possibilities; and presents the future
  tasks to be accomplished.%

  Ideally, one needs long-term time series of solar-radiation data and
  temperature data for each specific site at the hourly level. Such data are
  relatively rare, so in recent years statistical approaches have been
  developed to help fill the gap. Long series of daily data are needed for
  sizing and modeling of stand-alone systems. Effective statistical approaches
  have to recognize the links between solar-radiation data and temperature
  data. Solar-radiation data are often presented in a dimensionless form called
  the clearness index. The experience gained in the production of European
  Solar Radiation Atlas 2000 has indicated the great importance of having daily
  time series of global radiation for making sensibly reliable design
  decisions. Otherwise, the day-to-day variability patterns in solar radiation
  due to weather change will be lost. The daily global radiation can be
  profiled to match the clear-day profile to estimate hourly irradiation values
  with an acceptable loss in accuracy. The monthly mean values cannot be used
  with accuracy to simulate daily profiles.%

  The energy produced by a photovoltaic system over a given period can be
  estimated from the incident radiation at the site where the Grid Connected PV
  System (GCPVS) is located, assuming knowledge of certain basic features of
  the system under study. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of solar
  radiation, the question "How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this
  location over the next few years?" involves an exercise of prediction
  inevitably subjected to a degree of uncertainty. Moreover, during the life
  cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: "Is the system working
  correctly?". This paper proposes and examines several methods to cope with
  these questions. The daily performance of a PV system is simulated. This
  simulation and the interannual variability of both radiation and productivity
  are statistically analyzed. From the results several regression adjustments
  are obtained. This analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity
  prediction and performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical
  analysis of the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method
  of malfunctioning parts of the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  incident on a photovoltaic generator and to simulate the performance of
  several applications of the photovoltaic energy. This package performs the
  whole calculation procedure from both daily and intradaily global horizontal
  irradiation to the final productivity of grid-connected PV systems and water
  pumping PV systems. It is designed using a set of S4 classes whose core is a
  group of slots with multivariate time series. The classes share a variety of
  methods to access the information and several visualization methods. In
  addition, the package provides a tool for the visual statistical analysis of
  the performance of a large PV plant composed of several systems. Although
  solaR is primarily designed for time series associated to a location defined
  by its latitude/longitude values and the temperature and irradiation
  conditions, it can be easily combined with spatial packages for space-time
  analysis.%

  Abstract The incoming solar radiation is the essential climate variable that
  determines the Earth's energy cycle and climate. As long-term high-quality
  surface measurements of solar radiation are rare, satellite data are used to
  derive more information on its spatial pattern and its temporal variability.
  Recently, the EUMETSAT Satellite Application on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF)
  has published two satellite-based climate data records: Surface Solar
  Radiation Data Set-Heliosat, Edition 2 (SARAH-2), and Clouds and Radiation
  Data Set based on AVHRR (advanced very high resolution radiometer) Satellite
  Measurements, Edition 2 (CLARA-A2). Both data records provide estimates of
  surface solar radiation. In this study, these new climate data records are
  compared to surface measurements in Europe during the period 1983–2015.
  SARAH-2 and CLARA-A2 show a high accuracy compared to ground-based
  observations (mean absolute deviations of 6.9 and 7.3 W/m2, respectively)
  highlighting a good agreement considering the temporal behavior and the
  spatial distribution. The results show an overall brightening period since
  the 1980s onward (comprised between 1.9 and 2.4 W/m2/decade), with
  substantial decadal and spatial variability. The strongest brightening is
  found in eastern Europe in spring. An exception is found for northern and
  southern Europe, where the trends shown by the station data are not
  completely reproduced by satellite data, especially in summer in southern
  Europe. We conclude that the major part of the observed trends in surface
  solar radiation in Europe is caused by changes in clouds and that remaining
  differences between the satellite- and the station-based data might be
  connected to changes in the direct aerosol effect and in snow cover.%

  The irradiance fluctuations and the subsequent variability of the power
  output of a PV system are analysed with some mathematical tools based on the
  wavelet transform. It can be shown that the irradiance and power time series
  are nonstationary process whose behaviour resembles that of a long memory
  process. Besides, the long memory spectral exponent $\alpha$ is a useful
  indicator of the fluctuation level of a irradiance time series. On the other
  side, a time series of global irradiance on the horizontal plane can be
  simulated by means of the wavestrapping technique on the clearness index and
  the fluctuation behaviour of this simulated time series correctly resembles
  the original series. Moreover, a time series of global irradiance on the
  inclined plane can be simulated with the wavestrapping procedure applied over
  a signal previously detrended by a partial reconstruction with a wavelet
  multiresolution analysis, and, once again, the fluctuation behaviour of this
  simulated time series is correct. This procedure is a suitable tool for the
  simulation of irradiance incident over a group of distant PV plants. Finally,
  a wavelet variance analysis and the long memory spectral exponent show that a
  PV plant behaves as a low-pass filter.%

  This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of satellite-based methods for
  deriving solar irradiance components for analyzing the impact of the external
  inputs that are normally associated to the satellite model. Different
  sensitivity calculations have been performed using as reference site the PSA
  (Solar Platform of Almeria) station placed at the south-east of Spain. Thus,
  the sensitivity to the aerosol information input has been addressed by
  comparing the estimations using aerosol input from AERONET data with those
  using aerosol dataset such as MODIS or MISR (based on satellite) and MACC
  (based on reanalysis). Sensitivity to the clear sky model choice has been
  also studied by using three different models, from the simpler ESRA model (in
  terms of input parameters) to the most sophisticated REST2. Finally, three
  global to direct conversion models (Louche, DirInt and DirIndex) have been
  included to explore the sensitivity of the direct normal irradiance
  estimations. The sensitivity analysis has shown the interrelations between
  the different cases according to the uncertainty of the input information
  used. The results have been analyzed for clear and non-clear sky conditions
  separately and for the DNI irradiance range of 400–900 W m−2 as a case
  of special interest for the concentrating solar power applications. The work
  presented here has as novelty the analysis of the propagation of uncertainty
  of individual models and atmospheric datasets in the framework of a
  satellite-based model for solar irradiance computation and their relative
  weights to the final performance of the model. An underestimation of AOD by
  50{\%} causes an error in the global horizontal irradiance calculated by a
  clear sky model of 3–5{\%} depending on the model used, and slightly less
  for an overestimation of AOD. For DNI the error ranges are 12–15{\%} and
  9–12{\%} for 50{\%} underestimation and overestimation of AOD
  respectively.%

  A study on the spatial variability of long term solar radiation in Vietnam
  and the results of clustering solar radiation into different regions are
  presented here. Vietnam has a dense and long network of sunshine duration
  measurements, and on the contrary the country has a scarce availability of
  solar irradiance measuring sites. The variability of long term solar
  radiation can be analyzed by determining daily global irradiation from
  sunshine duration. A model inspired in Angstrom equation has been developed
  using the canonical correlation analysis with good performance. The output of
  the model has been used for characterizing the dispersion of long term solar
  radiation and its spatial distribution has been also studied by clustering
  techniques. The comparison with the K{\"{o}}ppen climatic information remarks
  that Vietnam could be divided into 3-4 well defined zones of different solar

  Solar surface irradiance (SIS) and direct (SID) irradiance as well as
  effective cloud albedo (CAL) climate data records (CDR) derived from the
  Meteosat first generation satellites (Meteosats 2 to 7, 1983-2005) are
  presented. The CDRs are available free of charge for all purposes from
  wui.cmsaf.eu at monthly, daily and hourly means at a spatial resolution of
  0.03.The processing employed a climate version of the Heliosat algorithm
  combined with a clear sky model using an eigenvector look-up table method.
  Modifications to the Heliosat method include a self-calibration algorithm as
  well as a running mean based clear sky retrieval algorithm.The datasets are
  validated using ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation
  Network (BSRN) as a reference. The validation threshold for the mean absolute
  bias between satellite-derived and surface-measured radiation is given by the
  target accuracy for solar irradiance fields defined by the Global Climate
  Observing system (GCOS) and a measurement uncertainty for the surface data.
  The results demonstrate that the target accuracy is achieved for monthly and
  daily means. Furthermore, an intercomparison with similar datasets reveal a
  better performance and climate monitoring potential of the CM SAF SIS CDR at
  most BSRN sites compared to established data sets like e.g. ERA-reanalysis,
  GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International
  Satellite Cloud Climatology Project). Lastly, the realistic representation of
  both seasonal and inter-annual variability guarantees the applicability of
  the satellite-based climate data sets for climate monitoring and analysis of
  extremes.No trends in the normalized bias between the CM SAF and the BSRN
  datasets are detectable, which demonstrates the stability and homogeneity of
  the global and direct irradiance for the period covered by BSRN measurements.
  However, inconsistencies are detectable at few satellite transition dates for
  certain regions in earlier years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.%

  We explore the relationship between the NAO and the solar radiation
  spatio-temporal variability in the European North Atlantic area during
  winter. Measured monthly sums of sunshine duration and short-wave downward
  solar flux reanalysis data have been used. Correlation analysis between the
  NAO index and the measured sunshine duration shows a dipolar pattern, with
  maximum positive values (+0.75) over the Iberian Peninsula, and maximum
  negative values (−0.71) over Norway. Reanalysis results confirm these
  findings. Composite analysis shows, for northern Europe, negative anomalies
  (−10{\%} to −20{\%}) associated with NAO {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 1 and
  positive anomalies (10{\%} to 20{\%}) associated with NAO {\{}{\textless}{\}}
  −1; while for southern Europe anomalies are, respectively, 10{\%} to 20{\%}
  and −10{\%} to −20{\%}. A stronger influence is found during the NAO
  negative phase; particularly, the northern British Isles, Norway and the
  Iberian Peninsula present a significant non-linear response, with higher
  anomalies (10{\%} to 20{\%}) during this negative phase.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The importance for reliable forecasts of incoming solar radiation is growing
  rapidly, especially for those countries with an increasing share in
  photovoltaic (PV) power production. The reliability of solar radiation
  forecasts depends mainly on the representation of clouds and aerosol
  particles absorbing and scattering radiation. Especially under extreme
  aerosol conditions, numerical weather prediction has a systematic bias in the
  solar radiation forecast. This is caused by the design of numerical weather
  prediction models, which typically account for the direct impact of aerosol
  particles on radiation using climatological mean values and the impact on
  cloud formation assuming spatially and temporally homogeneous aerosol
  concentrations. These model deficiencies in turn can lead to significant
  economic losses under extreme aerosol conditions. For Germany, Saharan dust
  outbreaks occurring 5 to 15 times per year for several days each are
  prominent examples for conditions, under which numerical weather prediction
  struggles to forecast solar radiation adequately. We investigate the impact
  of mineral dust on the PV power generation during a Saharan dust outbreak
  over Germany at 4 April 2014 using ICON-ART, which is the current German
  numerical weather prediction model extended by modules accounting for trace
  substances and related feedback processes. We find an overall improvement of
  the PV power forecast for 65{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the pyranometer stations in
  Germany. Of the nine stations with very high differences between forecast and
  measurement, eight stations show an improvement. Furthermore, we quantify the
  direct radiative effects and indirect radiative effects of mineral dust. For
  our study, direct effects account for 64{\&}thinsp;{\%}, indirect effects for
  20{\&}thinsp;{\%} and synergistic interaction effects for 16{\&}thinsp;{\%}
  of the differences between the forecast including mineral dust radiative
  effects and the forecast neglecting mineral dust.%

  Repowering of a wind farm is the process of replacing existing wind turbines
  with new turbines that either have a larger nameplate capacity or more
  efficiency, resulting in a net increase of the power generated. Although
  repowering brings, both, social and private benefits, there are also several
  obstacles to repowering which justify public support. The aim of this paper
  is to provide an overview and a qualitative analysis of instruments and
  design options to support repowering of on-shore wind farms. The
  multicriteria analysis carried out in this paper shows that all instruments
  have their advantages and drawbacks. However, feed-in tariffs and investment
  subsidies seem to be particularly appropriate instruments in this regard.
  Furthermore, we provide an assessment of different design options to promote
  repowering according to key assessment criteria. The relevance of design
  elements hinges on the fact that these are the ones directly affecting the
  variables that are relevant in the decision to repower (capacity factors and
  investment costs).%

  AbstractThe Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and
  vulnerable climate change “hotspots” of the twenty-first century, and the
  physical mechanisms underlying this finding are still not clear. Furthermore,
  complex interactions and feedbacks involving
  ocean–atmosphere–land–biogeochemical processes play a prominent role in
  modulating the climate and environment of the Mediterranean region on a range
  of spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is critical to provide robust
  climate change information for use in vulnerability–impact–adaptation
  assessment studies considering the Mediterranean as a fully coupled
  environmental system. The Mediterranean Coordinated Regional Downscaling
  Experiment (Med-CORDEX) initiative aims at coordinating the Mediterranean
  climate modeling community toward the development of fully coupled regional
  climate simulations, improving all relevant components of the system from
  atmosphere and ocean dynamics to land surface, hydrology, and biogeochemical
  processes. The primary goals of Med-CORDEX are to improve understanding of
  past climate variability and trends and to provide more accurate and reliable
  future projections, assessing in a quantitative and robust way the added
  value of using high-resolution and coupled regional climate models. The
  coordination activities and the scientific outcomes of Med-CORDEX can produce
  an important framework to foster the development of regional Earth system
  models in several key regions worldwide.%

  Electricity from wind and, to a lesser extent, solar energy is intermittent
  and not controllable. Unlike conventional power generation, therefore, this
  electricity is not suitable to supply base-load electric power. In the
  future, with greater penetration of these renewable sources, intermittency
  and control problems will become critical. Here, the authors explore the use
  of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for analyzing spatiotemporal
  balancing between regional solar and wind energy resources. The CCA allows
  optimal distribution of wind farms and solar energy plants across a territory
  to minimize the variability of total energy input into the power supply
  system. The method was tested in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula,
  a region covering about 350 000 km(2). The authors used daily-integrated wind
  and solar energy estimates in 2007 from the Weather Research and Forecasting
  (WRF) mesoscale model, at a spatial resolution of 9 km. Results showed
  valuable balancing patterns in the study region, but with a marked
  seasonality in strength, sign, and spatial coverage. The autumn season showed
  the most noteworthy results, with a balancing pattern extending almost over
  the entire study region. With location of reference wind farms and
  photovoltaic (PV) plants according to the balancing patterns, their combined
  power production shows substantially lower variability than production of the
  wind farms and PV plants separately and combined production obtained with any
  other locations. Atmospheric circulations associated with the balancing
  patterns were found to be significantly different between seasons. In this
  regard, synoptic-scale variability played an important role, but so did
  topographic conditions, especially near the Strait of Gibraltar.%

  Many clustering and segmentation algorithms both suffer from the limitation
  that the number of clusters/segments are specified by a human user. It is
  often impractical to expect a human with sufficient domain knowledge to be
  available to select the number of clusters/segments to return. In this paper,
  we investigate techniques to determine the number of clusters or segments to
  return from hierarchical clustering and segmentation algorithms. We propose
  an efficient algorithm, the L method, that finds the knee in a of clusters
  vs. clustering evaluation metric graph. Using the knee is well-known, but is
  not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of
  clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine
  in which situations it will and will not work. We also compare the L method
  to existing methods based on the accuracy of the number of clusters that are
  determined and efficiency. Our results show favorable performance for these
  criteria compared to the existing methods that were evaluated.%

  The operation of hydroelectric plants in Brazil depends on the hydrological
  regime, which is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations and faces
  critical levels of storage in certain periods. Hydropower accounts for 66{\%}
  of the countrys generation and poses a challenge for the stabilization of the
  grid in the mid and long terms. Usually, such fluctuations are complemented
  by conventional sources (thermo power). Studies have shown, however, that
  wind power can assist hydroelectric power generation. The water saved can be
  stored for energy generation and other purposes. This work addresses the
  possibility of complementing the hydro system with offshore wind power. To do
  so, monthly precipitation data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU-TS 3.1)
  [1] is compared with satellite winds from NOAA [2,3], to assess their
  variability on seasonal and interannual time scales. Results show high wind
  magnitudes in the North, Northeast, Southeast and Southern regions of Brazil.
  There is strong seasonal complementarity between the wind regimes of the
  Northeast and Northern regions. North and especially Northeast offshore winds
  were shown to be highly complementary with the hydrological regimes of
  S{\~{a}}o Francisco, Eastern Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, Paran{\'{a}},
  Paraguai, Uruguai and South Atlantic basins. In addition, the southern
  hydrographic basin variability was found uncorrelated with other hydrological
  basins and wind regions.%

  This study analyzes the spatial and temporal changes in sunshine duration
  (SunDu) and total cloud cover (TCC) over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and four
  subregions during 1961–2004 using high-quality, homogenized data sets. The
  analyses confirm that over most of the IP and in most seasons, SunDu and TCC
  variations are strongly negatively correlated, with absolute values
  ∼0.8–0.9. Somewhat weaker correlations (0.5–0.6) are found in the
  southern portion of the IP in summer. A large discrepancy between the SunDu
  and TCC records occurs from the 1960s until the early 1980s when the SunDu
  series shows a decrease that it is not associated with an increase in TCC.
  This negative trend or “dimming” is even more pronounced after removing
  the effects of TCC via linear regression. Since the early 1980s, the SunDu
  and TCC residual SunDu series exhibit an upward trend or “brightening.”
  In addition to the long-term dimming and brightening, the volcanic eruptions
  of El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo are clearly evident in the TCC residual
  SunDu record. The TCC and SunDu records over the IP are well correlated with
  sea level pressure (SLP), with above normal TCC and below normal SunDu
  corresponding to below normal SLP locally in all seasons. The TCC and SunDu
  related SLP changes over the IP in winter and spring are part of a
  larger-scale north-south dipole pattern that extends over the entire
  Euro-Atlantic sector. Other more regional atmospheric circulation patterns,
  identified from rotated principal component analysis, are also linked to TCC
  and SunDu variations over the IP. Finally and perhaps surprisingly, the TCC
  residual SunDu series exhibits a statistically significant relationship with
  a regional atmospheric circulation pattern during spring, summer, and
  autumn.%

  Trends of all-sky downward surface solar radiation (SSR) from
  satellite-derived data over Europe (1983–2010) are first presented. The
  results show a widespread (i.e., non-local dimension) increase in the major
  part of Europe, especially since the mid-1990s in the central and northern
  areas and in springtime. There is a mean increase of SSR of at least 2Wm−2
  per decade from 1983 to 2010 over the whole Europe, which, taking into
  account that the satellite-derived product lacks of aerosol variations, can
  be mostly related to a decrease in the cloud radiative effects over Europe.
  Secondly, residual series have been derived as the result of the difference
  between ground-based and satellite-derived all-sky SSR data. The residual
  mean series points to a significant increase during the period 1983–2010,
  with higher rates of around 2Wm−2 per decade over central and eastern
  Europe. The spatial variation of these residual time series, which are in
  line with clear-sky SSR trends over Europe reported in the literature, seem
  to suggest that these differences in the residual series are not just
  explained by calibration issues in the satellite-derived product.%

  Abstract There is a growing interest in the study of decadal variations in
  surface solar radiation during the last decades, although the analyses of
  long-term time series in some areas with major gaps in observations, such as
  in Spain, are still pending. This work describes for the first time the
  development of a new dataset of surface solar radiation in Spain based on the
  longest series with records of global solar radiation (G), most of them
  starting in the early 1980s. Additional records of diffuse solar radiation
  (D), which is a component of G much less studied due to the general scarcity
  of long-term series, are available for some of these series. Particular
  emphasis is placed upon the homogenization of this dataset in order to ensure
  the reliability of the trends, which can be affected by non-natural factors
  such as relocations or changes of instruments. The mean annual G series over
  Spain shows a tendency to increase during the 1985–2010 period, with a
  significant linear trend of + 3.9 W m− 2 per decade. Similar significant
  increases are observed in the mean seasonal series, with the highest rate of
  change during summer (+ 6.5 W m− 2 per decade) and secondly in autumn (+
  4.1 W m− 2 per decade) and spring (+ 3.2 W m− 2 per decade). These
  results are in line with the widespread increase of G, also known as
  brightening period, reported at many worldwide observation sites.
  Furthermore, the annual mean D series starts without relevant variations
  during the second half of the 1980s, but it is disturbed by a strong increase
  in 1991 and 1992, which might reflect the signal of the Pinatubo volcanic
  eruption. Afterwards, the mean series shows a tendency to decrease up to the
  mid-2000s, with a significant linear trend of − 2.1 W m− 2 per decade
  during the 1985–2010 period. All these results point towards a diminution
  of clouds and/or aerosols over the area.%

  that the inter-annual trend in solar radiation between 1980 and 2000 mirrors
  the trend in primary emissions of SO2 and black carbon, which together
  contribute about one-third of global average aerosol optical depth. Combined
  global emissions of these two species peaked in 1988–1989. The two-decadal
  rate of decline in aerosol loading resulting from these emission changes,
  0.13\% yr−1, can be compared with the reported increase in solar radiation
  of 0.10\% yr−1 in 1983–2001. Regional patterns of aerosol and radiation
  changes are also qualitatively consistent. We conclude that changes in the
  aerosol burden due to changing patterns of anthropogenic emissions are likely
  contributing to the trends in surface solar radiation.%

  During most of human history renewable energy has been the only energy option
  available. Only during the last few centuries has fossil and lately nuclear
  energy sources been used in a non-renewable way. They took over because they
  seemed much cheaper than the renewable sources. However, environmental
  problems of a local as well as a global magnitude are becoming evident, and
  questions are now being raised: are the fossil and nuclear choices indeed the
  cheapest; could a full account of indirect costs be attempted? In any case,
  the renewable options have only been developed in some areas of the world,
  and the reasons for their successes and failures has to be discussed.

  We combine global distributions of aerosol loading resulting from transport

  Globally, sulfate, dust, and carbonaceous particles appear to contribute

  for aerosol retrievals from satellite measurements.%

  Climate change may alter the geographical pattern and intensity of
  near-surface winds which are the "fuel" for wind turbines. In a context of
  fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating
  the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This
  study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power
  generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production
  from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020.
  For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an
  ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate
  Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission
  scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large
  multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the
  estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We
  show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most
  of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within ±15 and ±20
  {\%} by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward
  a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an
  increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will
  not exceed 5 and 15 {\%} in magnitude at the European and national scale
  respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned
  by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind
  energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects
  in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy
  mix plans.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]%

  The electricity sector is currently considered mainly on the emission side of
  the climate change equation. In order to limit climate warming to below
  2 °C, or even 1.5 °C, it must undergo a rapid transition towards carbon
  neutral production by the mid-century. Simultaneously, electricity generating
  technologies will be vulnerable to climate change. Here, we assess the
  impacts of climate change on wind, solar photovoltaic, hydro and
  thermoelectric power generation in Europe using a consistent modelling
  approach across the different technologies. We compare the impacts for
  different global warming scenarios: +1.5 °C, +2 °C and +3 °C.
  Results show that climate change has negative impacts on electricity
  production in most countries and for most technologies. Such impacts remain
  limited for a 1.5 °C warming, and roughly double for a 3 °C warming.
  Impacts are relatively limited for solar photovoltaic and wind power
  potential which may reduce up to 10{\%}, while hydropower and thermoelectric
  generation may decrease by up to 20{\%}. Generally, impacts are more severe
  in southern Europe than in northern Europe, inducing inequity between EU
  countries. We show that a higher share of renewables could reduce the
  vulnerability of power generation to climate change, although the variability
  of wind and solar PV production remains a significant challenge.%

  This paper explores the possibilities provided by satellite-based surface
  solar irradiation databases, for the attention of the photovoltaic actors,
  from the engineering and the financing to the operating of photovoltaic
  systems. First, the problematic of using meteorological ground stations for
  the determining of solar dataset or time-series is addressed with the example
  of the French national meteorological network and the focus made on the
  South-West part of France: the heterogeneity in terms of spatial and temporal
  representativeness along with the relevance of the delivered measurement are
  questioned. Then, an innovative synthesis of 16 satellite-based ISS databases
  available so far is presented through the distribution of their corresponding
  features within three categories: spatial and temporal representativeness,
  data type in terms of component and format, and finally operating mode for
  the retrieving of the data in terms of price and accessibility. The results
  of this review shall help photovoltaic actors making the correlation between
  the available satellite-based databases and their specific needs.%

  Integrating variable and non-dispatchable renewable power generation into
  existing power systems will have consequences for their operation and future
  expansion. These impacts will depend on two factors: (1) the variability of
  the total renewable power generation on different time scales and (2) the
  possibilities of accurately forecasting these fluctuations. In this paper,
  previous research on variability assessment and forecasting of solar, wind,
  wave and tidal energy resources is reviewed. The aim is to summarize the
  state of knowledge in each area and to compare the approaches used for the
  respective resources. For temporal variability, methods and models used for
  assessing the variability are surveyed, as well as what is known about the
  variability at individual sites and for larger aggregates of sites. For
  forecasting, an overview of forecasting methods for the different resources
  is made, and selected forecasting methods are compared over different time
  horizons. An important finding is that it is hard to draw strong conclusions
  from the existing studies due to differences in approaches and presentation
  of results. There is a need for further, more coherent studies that analyze
  the variability for the different resources in comparable ways, using data
  with the same resolution, and for studies that evaluate the smoothing effect
  and complementarity of combinations of several renewable energy resources.
  For forecasting, future research should suggest ways to evaluate forecasts
  from different renewable energy sources in easily comparable ways, using data
  from the same locations or regions, with the same temporal and spatial
  resolution, and with comparable metrics for the forecasting errors.%

  Monitored data from 100 PV systems were used to study effects of combined

  Variations in solar radiation incident at Earth's surface profoundly affect
  the human and terrestrial environment. A decline in solar radiation at land
  surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a
  phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from
  1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the
  dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has
  been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with
  changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially
  affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.%

  There is increasing evidence that the amount of solar radiation incident at
  the Earth's surface is not stable over the years but undergoes significant
  decadal variations. Here I review the evidence for these changes, their
  magnitude, their possible causes, their representation in climate models, and
  their potential implications for climate change. The various studies
  analyzing long-term records of surface radiation measurements suggest a
  widespread decrease in surface solar radiation between the 1950s and 1980s
  (''global dimming''), with a partial recovery more recently at many locations
  (''brightening''). There are also some indications for an ''early
  brightening'' in the first part of the 20th century. These variations are in
  line with independent long-term observations of sunshine duration, diurnal
  temperature range, pan evaporation, and, more recently, satellite-derived
  estimates, which add credibility to the existence of these changes and their
  larger-scale significance. Current climate models, in general, tend to
  simulate these decadal variations to a much lesser degree. The origins of
  these variations are internal to the Earth's atmosphere and not externally
  forced by the Sun. Variations are not only found under cloudy but also under
  cloud-free atmospheres, indicative of an anthropogenic contribution through
  changes in aerosol emissions governed by economic developments and air
  pollution regulations. The relative importance of aerosols, clouds, and
  aerosol-cloud interactions may differ depending on region and pollution
  level. Highlighted are further potential implications of dimming and
  brightening for climate change, which may affect global warming, the
  components and intensity of the hydrological cycle, the carbon cycle, and the
  cryosphere among other climate elements.%

  Methods applied on efficient planning of ground-based monitoring networks of

  This pair of articles presents the results of a study about forecasting
  photovoltaic (PV) electricity production for some power plants in mainland
  France. Forecasts are built with statistical methods exploiting outputs from
  numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Contrary to most other studies,
  forecasts are built without using technical information on the power plants.
  In each article, several statistical methods are used to build forecast
  models and their performance is compared by means of adequate scores. When a
  best forecast emerges, its characteristics are then further assessed in order
  to get a deeper insight of its merits and flaws. The robustness of the
  results are evaluated with an intense use of cross-validation.This article
  deals with probabilistic forecasts of daily production 2. days ahead. By
  "probabilistic" we mean that our forecast models yield some quantiles of the
  expected production's probability distribution. Whereas probabilistic
  forecasts are quite usual in wind power forecasting, they are more unusual in
  the field of PV production forecasting. We show that our eight forecasts
  always perform better than a simple climatological reference forecast.
  Nevertheless, no forecast model clearly dominates the other, whatever the
  studied power plant. A post-processing technique aiming at improving
  forecasts may in fact decrease their performance. Finally, we use outputs
  from an ensemble NWP model in order to add information about the
  meteorological forecast uncertainty. Sometimes this ensemble improves the
  performance of forecasts, but this is not always true. {\textcopyright} 2014

  This work presents a cluster analysis for the determination of coherent zones
  of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) for a utility scale territory in
  California, which is serviced by San Diego Gas {\&} Electric. Knowledge of
  these coherent zones, or clusters, would allow utilities and power plants to
  realize cost savings through regional planning and operation activities such
  as the mitigation of solar power variability through the intelligent
  placement of solar farms and the optimal placement of radiometric stations.
  In order to determine such clusters, two years of gridded satellite data were
  used to describe the evolution of GHI over a portion of Southern California.
  Step changes of the average daily clear-sky index at each location are used
  to characterize the fluctuation of GHI. The k-means clustering algorithm is
  applied in conjunction with a stable initialization method to diminish its
  dependency to random initial conditions. Two validity indices are then used
  to define the quality of the cluster partitions as well as the appropriate
  number of clusters. The clustering algorithm determined an optimal number of
  14 coherent spatial clusters of similar GHI variability as the most
  appropriate segmentation of the service territory map. In addition, 14
  cluster centers are selected whose radiometric observations may serve as a
  proxy for the rest of the cluster. A correlation analysis, within and between
  the proposed clusters, based both on single-point ground-based and
  satellite-derived measurements evaluates positively the coherence of the
  conducted clustering. This method could easily be applied to any other
  utility scale region and is not dependent on GHI data which shows promise for
  the application of such clustering methods to load data and/or other
  renewable resources such as wind. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.%

  We propose a novel methodology to select candidate locations for solar power
  plants that take into account solar variability and geographical smoothing
  effects. This methodology includes the development of maps created by a
  clustering technique that determines regions of coherent solar quality
  attributes as defined by a feature which considers both solar clearness and
  solar variability. An efficient combination of two well-known clustering
  algorithms, the affinity propagation and the k-means, is introduced in order
  to produce stable partitions of the data to a variety of number of clusters
  in a computationally fast and reliable manner. We use 15. years worth of the
  30-min GHI gridded data for the island of Lanai in Hawaii to produce,
  validate and reproduce clustering maps. A family of appropriate number of
  clusters is obtained by evaluating the performance of three internal validity
  indices. We apply a correlation analysis to the family of solutions to
  determine the map segmentation that maximizes a definite interpretation of
  the distinction between and within the emerged clusters. Having selected a
  single clustering we validated the clustering by using a new dataset to
  demonstrate that the degree of similarity between the two partitions remains
  high at 90.91{\%}. In the end we show how the clustering map can be used in
  solar energy problems. Firstly, we explore the effects of geographical
  smoothing in terms of the clustering maps, by determining the average ramp
  ratio for two location within and without the same cluster and identify the
  pair of clusters that shows the highest smoothing potential. Secondly, we
  demonstrate how the map can be used to select locations for GHI measurements
  to improve solar forecasting for a PV plant, by showing that additional
  measurements from within the cluster where the PV plant is located can lead
  to improvements of 10{\%} in the forecast.%
