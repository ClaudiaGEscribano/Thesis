abstract = {The statistics of hourly global radiation are analysed for various climates and locations, at time scales ranging from one month to one hour. The probabilistic and sequential properties of the hourly clearness index ktare related with a variety of parameters, including the daily clearness index Ktand the solar altitude angle h, thereby displaying the nonstationary and time-inhomogeneous nature of hourly radiation. Analytical expressions for the probability distribution of ktare proposed (truncated Gaussian functions depending on Ktand h). The results reported in this paper provide a deeper understanding of hourly solar radiation statistics, and explain some of the features displayed by radiation data at longer time scales. From the practical point of view they have implications, for example, for the construction of models for generating synthetic radiation data, an important and often indispensable tool for designing and simulating solar systems. {\textcopyright}1992.},

abstract = {Forecasting the AC power output of a PV plant accurately is important both for plant owners and electric system operators. Two main categories of PV modeling are available: the parametric and the nonparametric. In this paper, a methodology using a nonparametric PV model is proposed, using as inputs several forecasts of meteorological variables from a Numerical Weather Forecast model, and actual AC power measurements of PV plants. The methodology was built upon the R environment and uses Quantile Regression Forests as machine learning tool to forecast AC power with a confidence interval. Real data from five PV plants was used to validate the methodology, and results show that daily production is predicted with an absolute cvMBE lower than 1.3{\%}.},

abstract = {We present an atmosphere–ocean regional climate model for the Mediterranean basin, called the PROTHEUS system, composed by the regional climate model RegCM3 as the atmospheric component and by a regional configuration of the MITgcm model as the oceanic component. The model is applied to an area encompassing the Mediterranean Sea and compared to a stand-alone version of its atmospheric component. An assessment of the model performances is done by using available observational datasets. Despite a persistent bias, the PROTHEUS system is able to capture the inter-annual variability of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) and also the fine scale spatio-temporal evolution of observed SST anomalies, with spatial correlation as high as 0.7 during summer. The close inspection of a 10-day strong wind event during the summer of 2000 proves the capability of the PROTHEUS system to correctly describe the daily evolution of SST under strong air–sea interaction conditions. As a consequence of the model's skill in reproducing observed SST and wind fields, we expect a reliable estimation of air–sea fluxes. The model skill in reproducing climatological land surface fields is in line with that of state of the art regional climate models.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) sensitivity to eight different combinations of cumulus, microphysics, and planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes over a topographically complex region in southern Spain (Andalusia) for the period 1990–99. The WRF configuration consisted of a 10-km-resolution domain nested in a coarser domain driven by 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data, with spectral nudging above the PBL employed over the latter domain. The model outputs have been compared at different time scales with an observational dataset that comprises 438 rain gauges and 152 temperature stations with records of both daily maximum and minimum temperatures. To reduce the ‘‘representation error,'' the validation with observations has been performed using a multistep regionalization that distinguishes five precipitation regions and four temperature regions. The analysis proves that both cumulus and PBL schemes have a crucial impact on the description of precipitation in Andalusia, whereas no noticeable differences between microphysics options were appreciated. Temperature is described similarly by all the configurations, except for the PBL choice affecting minimum values. WRF provides a definite improvement over ERA-40 in the climate description in terms of frequency, spatial distribution, and intensity of extreme events. It also captures more accurately the annual cycle and reduces the biases and the RMSE for monthly precipitation, whereas only a minor enh2ancement of these features was obtained for monthly-mean maximum and minimum temperatures. The results indicate that WRF is able to correctly reproduce Andalusian climate and produces useful added-value information for climate studies.},

abstract = {Several very simple clear sky and cloudy sky global irradiance models were tested under the climate and latitudes of Romania (Eastern Europe). The very simple clear sky models do not require meteorological data while the very simple cloudy sky models need only data on the total cloud amount. Three slightly more complex cloudy sky models which use additional meteorological inputs were also tested. The mean absolute error of the very simple clear sky models varies between 7 and 14{\%} in July and between 12 and 19{\%} in January. The best model originates from Western Europe. The performance of the very simple cloudy sky models is comparable to that of the more complicated ones. This is the main conclusion of the paper. Generally, their root mean square error varies between 35 and 45{\%} in close agreement with results from the literature. Twelve classes of daily average cloudiness were defined. The model accuracy is better for the first six classes (with smaller cloud amount) and worse for the other six classes.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to estimate projected changes of global radiation parallel to the global warming in south-eastern Europe. As a first step, statistical dependence of global radiation from local cloud indicators is analysed for a short period (1992–1996). Global radiation is derived from METEOSAT visual images, whereas cloud coverage is described in two parallel ways: surface-based visual cloudiness from 171 stations of the region and satellite based Outgoing Long-wave Radiation (OLR). In the second step regression coefficients of these cloud indicators against the hemispherical mean temperature are determined using an adaptation of the method of instrumental variables in recent monotonously warming periods: i.e. 1973–1996 for cloudiness, and 1979–2000 for the OLR. The local variables are used as independent variables of the first step and as dependent variables of the second one. As the last step of the whole computation the regression coefficients derived in the first and second step are combined to calculate expected change of global radiation. The product of the two regression coefficients typically yields a few percent of relative changes in global radiation considering 0.5K hemispherical warming. The signs of the changes are overwhelmingly positive, indicating more solar energy expected to be available for agricultural and industrial purposes.},

abstract = {The objective of the present work is to compare the projections of surface solar radiation (SSR) simulated by four regional climate models (CCLM, RCA4, WRF, ALADIN) with the respective fields of their ten driving CMIP5 global climate models. First the annual and seasonal SSR changes are examined in the regional and in the global climate models based on the RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The results show significant discrepancies between the projected SSR, the multi-model mean of RCMs indicates a decrease in SSR of −0.60 W/m2 per decade over Europe, while the multi-model mean of the associated GCMs used to drive the RCMs gives an increase in SSR of +0.39 W/m2 per decade for the period of 2006--2100 over Europe. At seasonal scale the largest differences appear in spring and summer. The different signs of SSR projected changes can be interpreted as the consequence of the different behavior of cloud cover in global and regional climate models. Cloudiness shows a significant decline in GCMs with −0.24{\%} per decade which explains the extra income in SSR, while in case of the regional models no significant changes in cloudiness can be detected. The reduction of SSR in RCMs can be attributed to increasing atmospheric absorption in line with the increase of water vapor content. Both global and regional models overestimate SSR in absolute terms as compared to surface observations, in line with an underestimation of cloud cover. Regional models further have difficulties to adequately reproduce the observed trends in SSR over the past decades.},

abstract = {The combination of hydroelectric and photovoltaic sources of energy in a generation system may seem unfeasible due to the still quite high costs of the photovoltaic plants. However in the next few decades, significant reductions in those costs are to be expected. Moreover, this combination may reduce the cost of plants implemented in low hydroelectric potential sites for which main system interconnection costs prove prohibitive. The study of hybrid hydro-PV generating plants allows the evaluation of the use of water reservoirs and battery banks as alternatives for energy storage within a system. It also allows the evaluation of the advantages of generation from complementary energy sources. The objectives of this paper is to propose the concept of a theoretical performance limit for the plants and propose a method for the determination of this performance limit using computer simulations with idealized energy availability functions. Using this method, the effect of different degrees of complementarity in time of the energy resources on the performance of hydro PV plants is studied. It has been observed that, as expected, the smallest failure indexes measuring the energy supply to the consumers are associated to the best complementarity in time indexes. The results of the simulations led to the synthesis of failure index curves, as functions of the different degrees of complementarity in time, with data obtained solely with the utilization of idealized functions describing the energy availabilities, as proposed in this work. The results so obtained are a preliminary set treating the influence of the complementarity characteristics on the performance of hybrid plants based on hydro and solar energies and show how the complementarity characteristics may be used to design hybrid power generation systems showing improved efficiency. The subsequent research work shall proceed to at least two different phases. In the first one, the method exposed in the present work shall be applied to real data and compared to the operation of existing hydro PV plants. In the second phase the obtained relations of the performance of the system to the different degrees of complementarity shall be confronted with design parameters of hydroelectric-photovoltaic plants based on complementary resources. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report two human factors studies performed to investigate human performance in tasks involving dextrous manipulations of virtual objects with haptic feedback. These studies were performed at the Man-Machine Interface Laboratory (Rutgers University, NJ, USA) and at the Laboratoire de Robotique de Paris (CRIIF-LRP). Different haptic devices were used : the Rutgers Master, the LRP Force Feedback Glove (LRP), and the ITR device (Interface Technology Research, UK). These experiments involved (1) accurate placements of virtual objects and (2) grasping-force regulation. In the former case, we compared the LRP FFG (that provides complex haptic cueing) and the ITR device(that provides binary haptic cueing : grasped/not grasped). In the latter case, we investigated the effect of sensory substitution (synesthetic representation of haptic informations) to convey virtual haptic cues using the visual and auditory sensory channels. Results of the experiments showed that (1) information redundancy (display of visual or auditory force feedback in addition to finger force feedback) allowed to increase performance compared to finger force feedback alone, and (2) simple tactual feedback (provided by the ITR device) allowed similar performance than complex force feedback (provided by the LRP FFG). This result led us to think that complex force feedback cues are not required in simple manipulation task (i.e. when grasping regulation forces is not crucial). In this case binary haptic information could be sufficient},

abstract = {We use reanalysis data to investigate the daily co-variability of wind and solar irradiance in Britain, and its implications for renewable energy supply balancing. The joint distribution of daily-mean wind speeds and irradiances shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to the rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with wind speed throughout the year (−0.4≲$\rho$≲−0.2): there is a weak tendency for windy days to be cloudier. This is particularly true in Atlantic-facing regions (western Scotland, south-west England). The east coast of Britain has the weakest anticorrelation, particularly in winter, primarily associated with a relative increase in the frequency of clear-but-windy days. We also consider the variability in total power output from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In all months, daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar capacity. The scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately 70{\%}-solar to 30{\%}-wind. This work emphasises the importance of considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on long-term average relationships or correlations. In particular, the anticorrelation between wind and solar power in Britain cannot solely be relied upon to produce a well-balanced energy supply.},

@article{Blanco2018,
abstract = {A review of more than 60 studies (plus m4ore than 65 studies on P2G) on power and energy models based on simulation and optimization was done. Based on these, for power systems with up to 95{\%} renewables, the electricity storage size is found to be below 1.5{\%} of the annual demand (in energy terms). While for 100{\%} renewables energy systems (power, heat, mobility), it can remain below 6{\%} of the annual energy demand. Combination of sectors and diverting the electricity to another sector can play a large role in reducing the storage size. From the potential alternatives to satisfy this demand, pumped hydro storage (PHS) global potential is not enough and new technologies with a higher energy density are needed. Hydrogen, with more than 250 times the energy density of PHS is a potential option to satisfy the storage need. However, changes needed in infrastructure to deal with high hydrogen content and the suitability of salt caverns for its storage can pose limitations for this technology. Power to Gas (P2G) arises as possible alternative overcoming both the facilities and the energy density issues. The global storage requirement would represent only 2{\%} of the global annual natural gas production or 10{\%} of the gas storage facilities (in energy equivalent). The more options considered to deal with intermittent sources, the lower the storage requirement will be. Therefore, future studies aiming to quantify storage needs should focus on the entire energy system including technology vectors (e.g. Power to Heat, Liquid, Gas, Chemicals) to avoid overestimating the amount of storage needed.},

abstract = {Due to the rapidly growing photovoltaic (PV) market in Germany, solar electricity fed in the grid amounts already to a share of approx. 2{\%} of the total grid load during midday summertime. This is already a significant figure for grid operators. For several years a wind power prediction for wind energy is already available. But until now, there has been no operational solar electricity forecast. Therefore, the paper is aimed at providing an approach for a solar electricity forecast system based on the forecasts of the European center of midrange weather forecast ECMWF locally refined by model output statistics MOS with local weather stations. To evaluate the results, they have been compared with measured values of several thousand PV plants in Germany. The results show for daily values an RMSE of 24.5 {\%} for the months July and August 2006, which is of course a satisfying result. Keywords: Forecasting, Utilities, Grid-connected},

abstract = {The interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological conditions are often ignored in favor of single-year data sets for modeling power generation and evaluating the economic value of photovoltaic (PV) power systems. Yet interannual variability significantly impacts the generation from one year to another of renewable power systems such as wind and PV. Consequently, the interannual variability of power generation corresponds to the interannual variability of capital returns on investment. The penetration of PV systems within the Hawaiian Electric Companies' portfolio has rapidly accelerated in recent years and is expected to continue to increase given the state's energy objectives laid out by the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. We use the National Solar Radiation Database (1998–2015) to characterize the interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological conditions across the State of Hawaii. These data sets are passed to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisory Model (SAM) to calculate an 18-year PV power generation data set to characterize the variability of PV power generation. We calculate the interannual coefficient of variability (COV) for annual average global horizontal irradiance (GHI) on the order of 2{\%} and COV for annual capacity factor on the order of 3{\%} across the Hawaiian archipelago. Regarding the interannual variability of seasonal trends, we calculate the COV for monthly average GHI values on the order of 5{\%} and COV for monthly capacity factor on the order of 10{\%}. We model residential-scale and utility-scale PV systems and calculate the economic returns of each system via the payback period and the net present value. We demonstrate that studies based on single-year data sets for economic evaluations reach conclusions that deviate from the true values realized by accounting for interannual variability.},

abstract = {Solar energy use in the UK is increasing dramatically, providing both heat energy and generation of electricity. This trend is expected to continue due to solar technologies becoming cheaper and more readily available along with low carbon government legislation such as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and Feed in Tariffs (FiTs) supporting solar energy deployment. However, the effects of climate change on the solar resource remain largely unstudied. Climate change affects cloud cover characteristics and consequently directly affects the performance of solar energy technologies. This paper investigates the UK solar irradiation resource for both the present and future climates. The present solar irradiation level was assessed through the conversion of 30 years of observed historical monthly average sunshine duration data. The method and results are validated by comparing the converted solar irradiation levels to actual solar irradiance measurements at weather stations with significant historical records of solar irradiance data. The impact of climate change is investigated across different regions of the UK by using the UKCP09 probabilistic climate change projections. We find that the current average UK annual solar resource is 101.2Wm-2, ranging from 128.4 Wm-2 in the south of England to 71.8Wm-2 in the northwest of Scotland. It seems likely that climate change will increase the average resource in the south of the UK, while marginally decreasing it in the Northwest. The overall effect is a mean increase of the UK solar resource, however it will have greater seasonal variability and discrepancies between geographical regions will be reinforced. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {A method for identifying clusters of points in a multi - dimensional Euclidean space is described and its application to taxonomy considered. It reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek et al. (l951a), is constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by applying the criterion of minimum within-cluster sum of squares. This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a "variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by using the agglomerative method of Ward (1963) and the divisive method of Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).},

A spatiotemporal characterisation of the long-term statistics of extreme precipitation is performed, using a number of different diagnostic indices. Employing a novel approach based on the timing of extreme precipitation events a number of physically consistent subregions are defined. The comparison of different diagnostics over the Mediterranean domain and physically homogeneous sub-domains is presented and discussed, focussing on the relative impact of several model configuration features (resolution, coupling, physical parameterisations) on the performance in reproducing extreme precipitation events. It is found that the agreement between the observed and modelled long-term statistics of extreme precipitation is more sensitive to the model physics, in particular convective parameterisation, than to other model configurations such as resolution and coupling.},

abstract = {This study is an analysis of the seasonal all-sky surface solar radiation variability in Europe during 19702000 using surface observations from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA). On the basis of the annual means period 19701985, there is a statistically significant decline of 3.0{\%} decade1 (3.8 Wm2 decade1) followed by a nonsignificant rise of 0.3{\%} decade1 (0.4 Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. The behavior of the solar radiation for spring is similar to the annual series and has the strongest increase of 1.6{\%} decade1 (2.5 Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. In summer a similar evolution to the annual and spring time series is shown but has a stronger decline of 3.2{\%} decade1 (6.8 Wm2 decade1) during 19701985. A small positive nonsignificant trend is reported for the winter means time series while a statistically significant negative trend of 2.5{\%} decade1 (2.1 Wm2 decade1) was found in autumn during 19702000. By comparing variations in all-sky solar radiation with changes in cloud cover and NAO, we attribute the winter and autumn trends mainly to the NAO through the modification of mid-to-low cloud cover in southern Europe and the spring and summer trends to mid-to-low cloud cover in northern Europe. However, because the cloud cover and solar radiation relationship weakens in the low-frequency variability, it suggests that other effects such as aerosols may also play a role. In addition, aerosols could be interfering with the relationship between solar radiation and NAO, contributing to a strengthening of their correlation in the low-frequency variability during winter and autumn.},

A set of three 50 km resolution simulations run over Western Europe with the LAM ALADIN-Climate and the GCM ARPEGE-Climate are performed to address this issue.

abstract = {The correlations of Hottel, Whillier, Liu and Jordan between diffuse and hemispherical, and between instantaneous (hourly) values and daily totals of solar radiation are recalibrated against pyrheliometer data for five stations in the U.S. The validity of the Liu and Jordan approach is confirmed, and numerical inaccuracies of the original correlations are found to arise from three factors: (i) reliance on uncorrected measurements of diffuse insolation with pyranometer plus shade ring, (ii) use of a single value of extraterrestrial insolation for a whole month, and (iii) neglect of seasonal variations in the diffuse/hemispherical ratio. The new correlation for the daily total ratio of diffuse over hemispherical insolation agrees with results reported for India, Israel and Canada which included the shade ring correction. This suggests that latitude independence is a good approximation. The new correlations imply that the diffuse component is significantly larger than that predicted by the original formulas of Liu and Jordan. Analytical expressions are presented the parameters of which are obtained by a least squares fit to the data. The resulting formulas provide a complete description of the long term average insolation incident on surfaces of arbitrary orientation; the only meteorological input is the long term average daily total of hemispherical insolation on the horizontal surface. Comparison between model and data shows an accuracy better than 3 per cent for the long term average insolation available to solar correctors, both fixed and tracking. The model provides a framework for optimal matching between solar radiation and ideal concentrators (based on the principle of phase space conservation). In addition to computing radiation availability for solar collectors, the model can be used for calculating heating and cooling loads of buildings. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

ST and MOS are tested for the University of Rome “Tor Vergata” site. The models are trained and validated using one year data. Through a cross training procedure, the dependence of the models on the training year is also analyzed. The performance of ST, NWP and MOS models, together with the benchmark Persistence Model (PM), are compared. The ST model and the NWP model exhibit similar results.

abstract = {Building large solar power plants requires significant long-term investment so understanding impacts from climate change will aid financial planning, technology selection, and energy output projections. In this article we examine how projected changes in temperature and insolation over the 21st century will affect photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) output. Projected climate data was obtained from the coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models HadGEM1 and HadCM3 under the IPCC SRES A1B scenario which describes a future world of rapid economic growth with a balanced use of renewable and fossil fuel power generation. Our calculations indicate that under this scenario PV output from 2010 to 2080 is likely to increase by a few percent in Europe and China, see little change in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. CSP output is likely to increase by more than 10{\%} in Europe, increase by several percent in China and a few percent in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. The results are robust to uncertainty in projected temperature change. A qualitative analysis of uncertainty in projected insolation change suggests strongest confidence in the results for Europe and least confidence in the results for western USA. Changes in PV and CSP output are further studied by calculating fractional contributions from changes in temperature and insolation. For PV there is considerable variation in contribution depending on location. For CSP the contribution from changes in insolation is always dominant.},

Solar power forecasting is then necessary to better exploit this variability and to increase the penetration of photovoltaic power into the energy mix. Solar energy forecasting involves prediction of cloud property above a given point. For several hour ahead forecasts, using images from meteorological geostationary satellite is the most suitable solution. We propose a forecasting method based on a phase correlation algorithm for motion estimation between subsequent cloud maps derived from Meteosat-9 images. The method is assessed against state-of-the-art over a limited area over South of France for a 4-hour period. Cloud index maps are predicted. Our forecasting are 21 {\%} better than persistence in relative RMSE of cloud index. If state-of-the-art shows better results (23 {\%}), our algorithm reduces computing of 25 {\%} and then minimize operational solar forecasting constraints.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic production is mostly driven by the solar irradiance received at ground level. Forecasting surface solar irradiance remains to predict the cloudiness and combine it with the value of the irradiance modeled under a clear sky for the same area at the same forecast horizon. Thus, uncertainty of irradiance under clear sky can affect significantly the photovoltaic production forecast. Clear sky irradiance can be accurately computed if concentration of some atmospheric components (aerosol, water vapor and ozone) are sufficiently known above a location. Many clear sky models have been designed allowing a various number of inputs. In this work, we analyzed the performance of four different clear sky models. We compared their outputs against ground measurements located in Reunion Island, Corsica and French Guiana. We used the models with atmospheric parameters provided by two different sources (neighboring ground measurements and reanalysis). Best results lead to a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 3 {\%} and an absolute relative mean bias error (rMBE) less than 1 {\%}, for minutely irradiance. Using atmospheric parameters from reanalysis instead of punctual measurements significantly reduces errors in clear sky models.},

abstract = {The electricity sector is not only a substantial source of carbon emissions, but also vulnerable to climate change, both due to the growing share of renewables and due to temperature related changes in seasonal demand patterns. In this study we provide information on the impacts of +2°C global warming on heating and cooling electricity demand for 26 European countries, based on 11 EURO-CORDEX climate simulations, presenting mean changes but also weather-induced changes in peak demand. Smooth transition regression models are used to estimate the relationship between daily electricity consumption and population weighted temperature. Assuming present demographic and economic structures, global warming by 2°C reduces electricity consumption in most European countries. The reduced heating electricity demand outweighs the increase in cooling demand. The highest decrease in relative terms is found for Norway (up to −5.2{\%}), followed by Sweden, Estonia, Finland, and France. Italy is the only country for which an overall increase in electricity demand is projected. The decrease of electricity demand in absolute terms is projected to be by far the highest in France (between −10 TWh and −16 TWh p. a.). In most countries peak demand of electricity for cooling and heating increases, whereby climate scenario uncertainties in case of heating are high. Altogether, a cross-country comparison heavily suggests that climate is not the main driver for the amount of electricity used for heating and cooling purposes, but rather energy policy.},

abstract = {Within Task IX of the International Energy's Solar Heating and Cooling Programme, 12 models which simulate solar irradiance on horizontal surfaces were evaluated with data from seven countries. This paper presents the results of this study. Simple, widely applicable models were considered which use standard meteorological observations. Two models use cloud layer amount and type, three use total cloud amount, four use fractional sunshine, while the remaining four models partition measured global irradiation into direct beam and diffuse components. Data from 15 stations were used; four Australian, four European, three Canadian, and four American. In most cases three years of data were used for each station. Cloudiness regimes from relatively cloud free (Australia and Albuquerque) to relatively cloudy (European stations) were represented. Model performance was assessed from the mean bias error (MBE), the mean absolute error (MAB) and the root mean square error (RMSE). Quantitative ranking of models from these measures showed that cloud layer models provided the best global irradiation estimates (MBE {\textless} |0.2|; RMSE {\textless} 2.1 MJ/m2/day) and the partitioning models the best direct beam and diffuse irradiation estimates (MBE {\textless} |0.6|; RMSE {\textless} 1.6 MJ/m2day). However, RMSE results for 30-day means showed that layer models performed as well as the partitioning models for direct beam and diffuse irradiation. The performance of the better models showed little variation with either season or cloud cover: thus, they seem to be generally applicable. The performance of the better global irradiation models is probably limited more by inadequate meteorological measurements and observations than by defects in the models themselves.},

abstract = {Australia has an abundant solar energy resource that is likely to be used for energy generation on a large scale. Variable sources of electricity generation require knowledge of the nature of their variability at all time scales. This study examines the effect that El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have on solar radiation in Australia, in order to establish the role for seasonal forecasting of solar power. Calendar years are classified into their ENSO state using a sea surface temperature index. The ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis products are then used to estimate the effect of ENSO on global horizontal solar irradiance over the continent. A bootstrap technique is used to obtain confidence regions for the effect in both winter and summer. The main impact of ENSO occurs during winter over a large part of eastern Australia. Little impact was observed over the continent during summer. A similar analysis is conducted for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) to ensure that the observed ENSO effect is not a manifestation of the IOD. This study indicates that the ENSO phenomenon may account for solar energy changes of more than 10{\%} in some locations on a seasonal basis. We show that the solar radiation analysis is directly applicable to solar energy yield. Knowledge of this variability may influence the location of large solar generation plants. Also, there is a potential to predict solar energy a few months ahead by means of seasonal forecasting systems, which would help to assist with planning for electricity grid.},

abstract = {Repowering of a wind farm is the process of replacing existing wind turbines with new turbines that either have a larger nameplate capacity or more efficiency, resulting in a net increase of the power generated. Although repowering brings, both, social and private benefits, there are also several obstacles to repowering which justify public support. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview and a qualitative analysis of instruments and design options to support repowering of on-shore wind farms. The multicriteria analysis carried out in this paper shows that all instruments have their advantages and drawbacks. However, feed-in tariffs and investment subsidies seem to be particularly appropriate instruments in this regard. Furthermore, we provide an assessment of different design options to promote repowering according to key assessment criteria. The relevance of design elements hinges on the fact that these are the ones directly affecting the variables that are relevant in the decision to repower (capacity factors and investment costs).},

abstract = {Med-CORDEX simulations over the period 1979--2011 are evaluated with regard to their capability to represent observed decadal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region and improve upon previous generation simulations from the ENSEMBLES project in their various experimental set-ups. Such an evaluation is needed to inform the use of these simulations and also future model development. For temperature, both Med-CORDEX and ENSEMBLES simulations tend to provide comparable results: they generally capture the sign and timing of the anomalies but not the amplitude. In general, no clear stratification appears when considering different types of Med-CORDEX regional modeling systems. Rather, it is remarkable that certain periods are poorly represented by all systems with a general underestimation of the observed long-term temperature trend, mostly in the summer season, even with respect to the corresponding global drivers. For precipitation, the Med-CORDEX simulations are closer to observations than the other datasets, with some improvement with respect to ENSEMBLES dataset. In general, all the systems experience difficulties in representing anomalies during specific periods or for specific regions. These appear in part due to limitations in the reanalysis boundary forcing data. For instance, in the second part of 1980s, the spatial patterns of surface air temperature during DJF/MAM are generally poorly represented, as well as the regionally averaged MAM/JJA surface air temperature decadal anomalies. Overall, the evaluation suggests limited improvement in Med-CORDEX simulations compared to ENSEMBLES, and a lack of sensitivity to resolution or coupling configuration, with persisting problems in part likely related to the representation of surface processes that could also affect the viability of future projections (e.g. the estimation of temperature trends). A set of decadal variability evaluation metrics, as applied in this study, could be useful in the context of a broader evaluation framework.},

abstract = {The complementarity of two renewable energy sources, namely hydro and wind, is investigated. We consider the diversification effect of wind power to reduce the risk of water inflow shortages, an important energy security concern for hydropower-based economic zones (e.g. Qu{\'{e}}bec and Norway). Our risk measure is based on the probability of a production deficit, in a manner akin to the value-at-risk, simulation analysis of financial portfolios. We examine whether the risk level of a mixed hydro-and-wind portfolio of generating assets improves on the risk of an all-hydro portfolio, by relaxing the dependence on water inflows and attenuating the impact of droughts. Copulas are used to model the dependence between the two sources of energy. The data considered, over the period 1958-2003, are for the province of Qu{\'{e}}bec, which possesses large hydro and wind resources. Our results indicate that for all scenarios considered, any proportion of wind up to 30{\%} improves the production deficit risk profile of an all-hydro system. We can also estimate the value, in TW h, of any additional one percent of wind in the portfolio. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The topography, as resolved by the 500-km mesh of the CCM1, is necessarily highly distorted, but with the 60-km mesh of the MM4 the major mountain ranges are distinguished. To obtain adequate and consistent representations of surface climate, we use the same radiation and land surface treatments in both models, the latter being the recently developed Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS). Our analysis emphasizes the simulation at four CCM1 points surrounding Yucca Mountain, NV, because of the need to determine its climatology prior to certification as a high-level nuclear waste repository.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for unsupervised dimension reduction. K-means clustering is a commonly used data clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks. Here we prove that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering. New lower bounds for K-means objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. These results indicate that unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning. Several implications are discussed. On dimension reduction, the result provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data reductions, beyond the conventional noisereduction explanation that PCA, via singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear approximation of the data. On learning, the result suggests effective techniques for K-means data clustering. DNA gene expression and Internet newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results. Experiments indicate that the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5 of the optimal values.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to synthesize the large literature recording changing patterns of precipitation in the observed data, thus indicating that climate change is already a reality. Such a synthesis is required not only for environmental researchers but also for policy makers. The key question is the broad picture at major regional and continental levels. Some interesting conclusions for this survey are emerging. For example, the review shows increased variance of precipitation everywhere. Consistent with this finding, we observe that wet areas become wetter, and dry and arid areas become more so. In addition, the following general changing pattern is emerging: (a) increased precipitation in high latitudes (Northern Hemisphere); (b) reductions in precipitation in China, Australia and the Small Island States in the Pacific; and (c) increased variance in equatorial regions. The changes in the major ocean currents also appear to be affecting precipitation patterns. For example, increased intensity and frequency of El Ni{\~{n}}o and ENSO seem associated with evidence of an observed “dipole” pattern affecting Africa and Asia, although this time series is too short so far. But the changing pattern calls for renewed efforts at adaptation to climate change, as the changing precipitation pattern will also affect the regional availability of food supply.},

abstract = {Solar cell performance decreases with increasing temperature, fundamentally owing to increased internal carrier recombination rates, caused by increased carrier concentrations. The operating temperature plays a key role in the photovoltaic conversion process. Both the electrical efficiency and the power output of a photovoltaic (PV) module depend linearly on the operating temperature. The various correlations proposed in the literature represent simplified working equations which can be apply to PV modules or PV arrays mounted on free-standing frames, PV-Thermal collectors, and building integrated photovoltaic arrays, respectively. The electrical performance is primarily influenced by the material of PV used. Numerous correlations for cell temperature which have appeared in the literature involve basic environmental variables and numerical parameters which are material or system dependent. In this paper, a brief discussion is presented regarding the operating temperature of one-sun commercial grade silicon-based solar cells/modules and its effect upon the electrical performance of photovoltaic installations. Generally, the performance ratio decreases with latitude because of temperature. However, regions with high altitude have higher performance ratios due to low temperature, like, southern Andes, Himalaya region, and Antarctica. PV modules with less sensitivity to temperature are preferable for the high temperature regions and more responsive to temperature will be more effective in the low temperature regions. The geographical distribution of photovoltaic energy potential considering the effect of irradiation and ambient temperature on PV system performance is considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.},

Autocorrelated temporal variations are suggested in the annual mean irradiance records at some of the sites and in normalized anomaly records for various combinations of the surface sites. These variations are illustrated by first-, second-, and third-degree polynomials as well as by a sinusoidal fit, all of which are used as data smoothers not necessarily representative of any related physical processes, although some fits yield statistically significant coefficients. In general, there is an indication of a decreasing tendency in the early portion of the records and then an increasing tendency until toward the very end of the record. Variations among field sites are seen, with the one Arctic site showing the most departure from the others, with primarily a downward trend for most of the record. The spatial representativeness of each site's annual mean record is investigated using spatial cross correlation with satellite-derived global estimates of the surface solar irradiance. These cross correlations show significant correlations with relatively large areas both contiguous and noncontiguous with the sites.},

From the 1990s to the present, a trend toward increasingly comprehensive coupled models of the entire climate system has dominated the field.

abstract = {A major part of renewable electricity production is characterized by a large degree of intermittency driven by the natural variability of climate factors such as air temperature, wind velocity, solar radiation, precipitation, evaporation, and river runoff. The main strategies to handle this intermittency include energy-storage, -transport, -diversity and -information. The three first strategies smooth out the variability of production in time and space, whereas the last one aims a better balance between production and demand. This study presents a literature review on the space-time variability of climate variables driving the intermittency of wind-, solar- and hydropower productions and their joint management in electricity systems. A vast body of studies pertains to this question bringing results covering the full spectrum of resolutions and extents, using a variety of data sources, but mostly dealing with a single source. Our synthesis highlights the consistency of these works, and, besides astronomic forcing, we identify three broad climatic regimes governing the variability of renewable production and load. At sub-daily time scales, the three considered renewables have drastically different pattern sizes in response to small scale atmospheric processes. At regional scales, large perturbation weather patterns consistently control wind and solar production, hydropower having a clearly distinct type of pattern. At continental scales, all renewable sources and load seem to display patterns of constant space characteristics and no indication of marked temporal trends.},

All RCMs reproduce the main areas of high cyclone occurrence in the region south of the Alps, in the Adriatic, Ionian and Aegean Seas, as well as in the areas close to Cyprus and to Atlas mountains. The RCMs tend to underestimate intense cyclone occurrences over the Mediterranean Sea and reproduce 24--40 {\{}{\%}{\}} of these systems, as identified in the reanalysis. The use of grid nudging in one of the RCMs is shown to be beneficial, reproducing about 60 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the intense cyclones and keeping a better track of the seasonal cycle of intense cyclogenesis. Finally, the most intense cyclones tend to be similarly reproduced in coupled and uncoupled model simulations, suggesting that modeling atmosphere--ocean coupled processes has only a weak impact on the climatology and intensity of Mediterranean cyclones.},

abstract = {Climate related energy sources such as wind, solar and runoff sources are variable in time and space, following their driving weather variables. High penetration of such energy sources might be facilitated by using their complementarity in order to increase the balance between energy load and generation. This study presents the analysis of the effect of a 100{\%} renewable energy mix composed by solar and run-of-the-river energy in Northern Italy where these two energy sources are the main alternative energy sources. Along a climate gradient from the Alpine crest (snow melt dominated area) to the Veneto plain (rainfall dominated area), solar power is generated in the flat plain, and run-of-the-river hydropower at two mountainous locations. Covering all possible mixes of these two sources, we analyze their complementarity across different temporal scales using two indicators: the standard deviation of the energy balance and the theoretical storage required for balancing generation and load. Results show that at small temporal scale (hourly), a high share of run-of-the-river power allows minimizing the energy balance variability. The opposite is obtained at larger temporal scales (daily and monthly) essentially because of lower variability of solar power generation, which also implies a lower storage requirement.},

abstract = {Medicanes are cyclones over the Mediterranean Sea having a tropical-like structure but a rather small size, that can produce significant damage due to the combination of intense winds and heavy precipitation. Future climate projections, performed generally with individual atmospheric climate models, indicate that the intensity of the medicanes could increase under climate change conditions. The availability of large ensembles of high resolution and ocean--atmosphere coupled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, performed in MedCORDEX and EURO-CORDEX projects, represents an opportunity to improve the assessment of the impact of climate change on medicanes. As a first step towards such an improved assessment, we analyze the ability of the RCMs used in these projects to reproduce the observed characteristics of medicanes, and the impact of increased resolution and air-sea coupling on their simulation. In these storms, air-sea interaction plays a fundamental role in their formation and intensification, a different mechanism from that of extra-tropical cyclones, where the baroclinic instability mechanism prevails. An observational database, based on satellite images combined with high resolution simulations (Miglietta et al. in Geophys Res Lett 40:2400--2405, 2013), is used as a reference for evaluating the simulations. In general, the simulated medicanes do not coincide on a case-by-case basis with the observed medicanes. However, observed medicanes with a high intensity and relatively long duration of tropical characteristics are better replicated in simulations. The observed spatial distribution of medicanes is generally well simulated, while the monthly distribution reveals the difficulty of simulating the medicanes that first appear in September after the summer minimum in occurrence. Increasing the horizontal resolution has a systematic and generally positive impact on the frequency of simulated medicanes, while the general underestimation of their intensity is not corrected in most cases. The capacity of a few models to better simulate the medicane intensity suggests that the model formulation is more important than reducing the grid spacing alone. A negative intensity feedback is frequently the result of air-sea interaction for tropical cyclones in other basins. The introduction of air-sea coupling in the present simulations has an overall limited impact on medicane frequency and intensity, but it produces an interesting seasonal shift of the simulated medicanes from autumn to winter. This fact, together with the analysis of two contrasting particular cases, indicates that the negative feedback could be limited or even absent in certain situations. We suggest that the effects of air-sea interaction on medicanes may depend on the oceanic mixed layer depth, thus increasing the applicability of ocean--atmosphere coupled RCMs for climate change analysis of this kind of cyclones.},

We analyze changes in precipitation mean and extremes and find that the change signal shows seasonally dependent fine scale structure in response to the topographic forcing and changes in circulation, especially over the Alpine region and the Iberian, Italian and Hellenic peninsulas. In winter, the mean precipitation change is positive in the Northern Mediterranean regions and negative in the Southern Mediterranean, while precipitation in the other seasons mostly decreases (especially in summer), except over some localized areas. Changes in extreme precipitation events and dry spells suggest not only shifts, but also a broadening, of the precipitation distribution, with an increased probability of occurrence of events conducive to both floods and droughts.},

abstract = {As solar energy will be an increasingly important renewable energy source in future years, the study of how climate change affects both its temporal and spatial variability is very relevant. In this paper, we study future changes of the solar radiation resource in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) through a set of simulations from ESCENA project (generation of regionalized scenarios of climate change in Spain with high-resolution models) until mid-century. The evaluation of the simulations against observations indicates contrasting biases for the different regional climate models (RCMs) in terms of solar irradiation amount and its inter-annual variability. We propose a diagnostic for the quality of solar energy resource, in which the gridpoints are classified in four categories depending on the combination of solar irradiation amount and variability. The observed large percentage of points in the optimal category (high irradiation/low variability) in the IP is well-captured by the RCMs in general terms. The analysis of scenarios indicates a future increase in solar irradiation, although not all scenarios agree in the geographical distribution of this increase. The quality of solar energy resource is projected to increase, mostly due to a decrease in variability. This is an important result, as a more stable inter-annual resource should decrease the need for backup sources and also reduce inter-annual electricity price variations. Finally, results from a first approximation to the issue of the ability of solar energy to cover power demand peaks in summer show important differences between regions of the IP. However, the spatially averaged correlation of solar irradiation and summer surface temperatures for the whole IP is rather high, which is a positive result as the strong interconnections of the power grid within the IP could allow a distribution of solar power surpluses in certain regions for such high-temperature episodes.},

It would be desirable that it is more stable over time than other energies with high interannual variability like hydropower. In this study we analyse the interannual variability of sunshine hours and precipitation over Spain, with the aim of comparing the reliability of solar energy to hydropower. An analysis in this respect has not been done before. We have used data from almost 100 stations in the WMO-AEMET (Spanish State Agency for Meteorology) network, and have applied two indices, the coefficient of variability (CV) and the speed of convergence, defined as the number of years of data needed to fully characterize a site. The main result is that the interannual variability for sunshine hours is several times lower than for precipitation over most of Spain, with the exception of the northern coast. The southwestern peninsular area stands out in this respect. This area is characterized at the same time by the highest number of sunshine hours, high speed of convergence and a low maximum departure of annual sunshine hours from the long-term mean. All this make this area optimal and very reliable for placing solar power plants.},

abstract = {Abstract A Limited Area Model (LAM) is nested in a General Circulation Model (GCM) to simulate the January climate over the western United States. In the nesting procedure, the GCM output is used to provide the initial and lateral atmospheric boundary conditions necessary to drive the LAM. In this approach, the GCM is used to simulate realistic large-scale atmospheric behavior over an area of interest and the LAM to describe the effect of local, sub-GCM grid scale forcings (such as those induced by the complex western United States topography) on regional patterns of climatic variables. Two versions of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model [the seasonal CCM1 at 4.5° × 7.5° (R15) and 2.89° × 2.89° (T42) latitude-longitude resolution] are used to drive a version of the Pennsylvania State University/NCAR mesoscale model (MM4 at 60 km resolution), which includes sophisticated soil hydrology calculations. The CCM1 large-scale January climatology over the region is analyzed first. Comparison with large-scale observations shows that geopotential height, zonal wind, temperature, relative humidity, cloudiness, precipitation and storm frequencies over the western United States and adjacent oceans are realistically simulated by both the T42 and R15 models. The T42 model, however, reproduces storm frequencies and strength and position of the jet stream better than the R15 model. A number of month-long January simulations were performed using both the R15 and T42 model outputs to drive the MM4. The large-scale average circulations over the western United States simulated by the nested MM4 are not substantially different from those of the driving CCM1, both when outputs from the R15 and T42 versions are used to drive the MM4. Owing to the more realistic topography in the MM4, the nested model system produces better regional detail of precipitation and temperature distribution than the CCM1 alone. Temperature and precipitation means, as well as frequencies of daily precipitation intensifies simulated by the nested MM4, compare well with high resolution observations, particularly in their spatial distribution. Also discussed am results of regional snow cover, cloudiness, and soil hydrology calculations included in the MM4.},

abstract = {We present a review of climate change projections over the Mediterranean region based on the most recent and comprehensive ensembles of global and regional climate change simulations completed as part of international collaborative projects. A robust and consistent picture of climate change over the Mediterranean emerges, consisting of a pronounced decrease in precipitation, especially in the warm season, except for the northern Mediterranean areas (e.g. the Alps) in winter. This drying is due to increased anticyclonic circulation that yields increasingly stable conditions and is associated with a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track. A pronounced warming is also projected, maximum in the summer season. Inter-annual variability is projected to mostly increase especially in summer, which, along with the mean warming, would lead to a greater occurrence of extremely high temperature events. The projections by the global and regional model simulations are generally consistent with each other at the broad scale. However, the precipitation change signal produced by the regional models shows substantial orographically-induced fine scale structure absent in the global models. Overall, these change signals are robust across forcing scenarios and future time periods, with the magnitude of the signal increasing with the intensity of the forcing. The intensity and robustness of the climate change signals produced by a range of global and regional climate models suggest that the Mediterranean might be an especially vulnerable region to global change.},

abstract = {Global climate projections consistently indicate a future decrease in summer precipitation over the European Alps 1–3 . However, topography can substantially modulate precipita-tion change signals. For example, the shadowing eeect by topographic barriers can modify winter precipitation change patterns 4,5 , and orographic convection might also play an important role 6,7 . Here we analyse summer precipitation over the Alpine region in an ensemble of twenty-first-century projections with high-resolution (∼12 km) regional climate models 8,9 driven by recent global climate model simulations 10 . A broad-scale summer precipitation reduction is projected by both model ensembles. However, the regional models simulate an increase in precipitation over the high Alpine elevations that is not present in the global simulations. This is associated with increased convective rainfall due to enhanced potential instability by high-elevation surface heating and moistening. The robustness of this signal, which is found also for precipitation extremes, is supported by the consistency across models and future time slices, the identification of an underlying mechanism (enhanced convection), results from a convection-resolving simulation 11 , the statistical significance of the signal and the consistency with some observed trends. Our results challenge the picture of a ubiquitous decrease of summer precipitation over the Alps found in coarse-scale projections. The hypothesis that topography might locally modify precipitation change patterns is particularly relevant for the European Alps, whose complex physiography is well known to strongly affect local climate characteristics 12 . Regional climate models (RCMs) are especially suitable tools to explore this issue since they can reach high horizontal resolutions, of the order of 10 km or less 8,11 . In this regard, an unprecedented ensemble of high-resolution (grid spacing of ∼12 km, or 0.11 •) RCM projections over the Mediterranean and European regions (both encompassing the Alps) have been completed as part of the CORDEX programme (COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment, ref. 13), and specifically the EURO-CORDEX 8 and MED-CORDEX 9 initiatives. In addition, a high-resolution (5 km) gridded observation data set is available for model assessment over the Alpine region 14 . These products thus provide optimal resources to investigate the issue of the impact of complex topography on precipitation change signals. Specifically, we here focus on summer precipitation over the Alps, which constitutes an important water source for the region 12,15 , in particular due to summer convection. While most global climate models (GCMs) project a ubiquitous decrease in summer precipitation over the Alps in response to global warming 1–3 , this response can be substantially affected by topography. Such a modulation would in fact point to the added value of using high-resolution models in regional climate projections. As shown in a previous study 15 the EURO-CORDEX and MED-CORDEX RCMs can reproduce well the observed fine-scale summer precipitation patterns over the Alps (for example, Supplementary Fig. 2), in particular improving the corresponding patterns in the driving GCMs. A number of studies demonstrated the added value of RCMs in reproducing different characteristics of topographically forced precipitation 9,15–17 . However, whether the added value in reproducing present-day climate also results into more credible projections is still an open issue 18 . Here we use an ensemble of projections with 6 RCMs at ∼12 km grid spacing driven by 4 different GCMs (Supplementary Table 1) and analyse three future twenty-first-century time slices (near term, 2010–2039; mid-century, 2040–2069; late century, 2070–2099) under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway 19 with respect to the present-day period 1975–2004 (see Methods). The domain of analysis encompasses the Alpine chain and surrounding areas (Supplementary Fig. 1), and is defined by the coverage area of the observation data set 14 . Figure 1 shows the ensemble mean of the percentage change in summer precipitation for the three twenty-first-century time slices in the driving GCM and the RCM ensembles. The GCMs produce a large-scale drying signal over the region, which grows in magnitude throughout the twenty-first century and extends to the entire Alpine region in the mid-and late century time slices (Fig. 1a–c). This precipitation reduction is in line with previous GCM-based projec-tions 1–3 , and it is associated with an increase in anticyclonic circula-tion over the Mediterranean and central European areas that locally enhances downward motions and deflects storms northward 2,3 . Contrary to the GCMs, the RCMs produce an area of increased summer precipitation along the Alpine chain embedded in the large-scale regional drying (Fig. 1d–f). This area covers most of the Alps in the near-term and mid-century time slices, while it is more limited to the highest peaks in the late century. This precipitation increase is qualitatively consistent with positive trends in precipitation ob-servations found across the Alps in the late twentieth century (Sup-plementary Fig. 3), when substantial warming occurred over the region 12 , and in parts of the Swiss Alps 20 , although these observed increases could in principle also be due to natural variability. Figure 1 also presents the ensemble average of what we call downscaling signal (DS, see Methods), which identifies the difference between RCM and GCM changes after the region-mean change values are filtered out, and it is therefore a direct measure of the local signal obtained via the RCM downscaling. Figure 1g–i shows that the summer precipitation change DS is positive along the Alpine chain and negative in the surrounding},

abstract = {We have estimated the radiative impact produced by an unusually extreme dust and wildfire episode on the performance of a photovoltaic (PV) plant. The dust and wildfire events were mostly active on 26–28 and 29–30 June 2012, respectively. We took advantage of the consecutiveness of both events to separate and derive empirically the radiative effect of dust and smoke aerosols. With this purpose, we employed measurements of aerosol load, radiation and PV power output from a collocated atmospheric station and PV plant located at Burjassot (Valencia, Spain). The empirical estimates were obtained by direct comparison with a summer background day, happened right before the two consecutive case studies. The whole episode is characterized by high aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm, reaching values up to 1 and 6 for dust and smoke, respectively. Our analysis shows an average daily energy loss of −132 kWh, that represents a fraction of 20{\%} of the energy generated by the PV plant on the reference summer background day. A significant fraction of the energy lost was due to smoke, with a daily maximum of 43{\%} and a daily average of 34{\%}. In case of dust, the energy reduction was moderated, with a daily average of 6{\%}. In terms of instantaneous power reduction, we have obtained peaks of 8 and 51{\%} for dust and smoke, respectively. The energy reduction due to aerosols is strongly dependent on AOD. Further, we have found that the power loss per unit of AOD at 870 nm is useful to separate the radiative impact of different aerosol types. Essentially, the efficiency of smoke to reduce the energy generated by the PV plant is much greater than that of dust. This effect is mainly due to the different optical properties in the near infrared that result in a daily Power Aerosol Forcing Efficiency at 870 nm of −5.7 and −19.1 kW, for dust and smoke, respectively. Our results indicate that both the AOD and aerosol type drive the radiative impact of aerosols on the PV output, confirming that extreme aerosol events may drastically reduce the power generated by operative PV plants. This reduction may be as large as that reported for particle soiling. Therefore, considering both amount and type of aerosols in the PV power analyses is mandatory in order to obtain accurate forecast scenarios and improve the grid integration, especially during extreme episodes.},

abstract = {Wind energy is susceptible to global climate change because it could alter the wind patterns. Then, improvement of our knowledge of wind field variability is crucial to optimize the use of wind resources in a given region. Here, we quantify the effects of climate change on the surface wind speed field over the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands using an ensemble of four regional climate models driven by a global climate model. Regions of the Iberian Peninsula with coherent temporal variability in wind speed in each of the models are identified and analysed using cluster analysis. These regions are continuous in each model and exhibit a high degree of overlap across the models. The models forced by the European Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) reanalysis are validated against the European Climate Assessment and Dataset wind. We find that regional models are able to simulate with reasonable skill the spatial distribution of wind speed at 10 m in the Iberian Peninsula, identifying areas with common wind variability. Under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B climate change scenario, the wind speed in the identified regions for 2031–2050 is up to 5{\%} less than during the 1980–1999 control period for all models. The models also agree on the time evolution of spatially averaged wind speed in each region, showing a negative trend for all of them. These tendencies depend on the region and are significant at p = 5{\%} or slightly more for annual trends, while seasonal trends are not significant in most of the regions and seasons.

abstract = {The intrinsic performance of 18 broadband radiative models is assessed, using high-quality datasets from five sites in widely different climates. The selected models can predict direct, diffuse and global irradiances under clear skies from atmospheric data, and have all been (or still are) involved in large-scale applications, for instance to prepare solar resource maps and datasets, or to evaluate solar radiation in GIS software. The input data to the models include accurate aerosol and water vapor measurements by collocated sunphotometers, if needed. Cloud occurrences are meticulously scrutinized through the use of various tools to avoid cloud contamination of the test data. The intrinsic performance of the models is evaluated by comparison between their predictions and measurements at high frequency (1-minute time step at four sites, 3-minute at one site). The total expanded uncertainty of these measurements is estimated at 3{\%} for direct irradiance, and 5{\%} for diffuse and global irradiance.Various statistics are calculated to evaluate the systematic and random differences between the data series, as well as the agreement between the cumulative distribution functions. In the latter case, stringent statistics based on the Komolgorov-Smirnov (KS) test are used. Large differences in performance are apparent between models. Those that require more atmospheric inputs perform usually better than simpler models. Whereas many models can predict the global horizontal irradiance within uncertainty limits similar to those of the radiation measurements, the prediction of direct irradiance is less accurate. Moreover, the prediction of diffuse horizontal irradiance is particularly deficient in most models. The cumulative distribution functions also denote areas of concern.A ranking of all models is proposed, based on four statistical indicators: mean bias difference (MBD), root mean square difference (RMSD), total uncertainty with 95{\%} confidence limits (U 95), and the newly introduced Combined Performance Index (CPI), which optimally combines two KS indices with RMSD. For direct irradiance, consistently high rankings are obtained with five models (REST2, Ineichen, Hoyt, Bird, and Iqbal-C, in decreasing order of performance) that require a relatively large number of atmospheric inputs. The inferior performance of models requiring little or no atmospheric inputs suggests that large-scale solar resource products derived from them may be inappropriate for serious solar applications. Additionally, prediction uncertainties under ideal clear-sky conditions can propagate and affect all-sky predictions as well-resulting in potential biases in existing solar resource maps at the continent scale, for instance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is responding to a growing demand for high-accuracy solar resource data with uncertainties significantly lower than those of existing solar resource datasets, such as the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Measurements for long-term solar resource characterizations require years to complete, which is an unacceptable timeline for the rapidly emerging needs of renewable energy applications. This contribution seeks methods of reducing the uncertainty of existing long-term solar resource datasets by incorporating lower-uncertainty site-specific ground measurements of a limited period of record. In particular, various techniques are being explored to make full use of the existing high-resolution radiation data available in the NSRDB and other sources, and extrapolate them over time using locally measured data and other supportive information. The interannual variability in global and direct radiation is studied here using long-term data at various sites. NSRDB's modeled data for the 1998-2005 period are compared to quality-controlled measurements to assess the performance of the model, which is found to vary greatly depending on climatic condition. The reported results are encouraging for applications involving concentrators at very sunny sites. Large seasonal biases are found at some cloudy sites. Various improvements are proposed to enhance the quality of the existing model and modeled data. The measurement of solar radiation to characterize the solar climate for renewable energy and other applications is a time consuming and expensive operation. Full climate characterization may require several decades of measurements-a prospect that is not practical for an industry intent on rapid deployment of solar technologies. This study demonstrates that the consistency of the solar resource in both time and space varies widely across the United States. The mapped results here illustrate regions with high and low variability and provide readers with quick visual information to help them decide where and how long measurements should be taken for a particular application. The underlying data that form these maps are also available from NREL to provide users the opportunity for more detailed analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Renewable energy resources are variable by nature. Due to this fact conventional electricity systems, which were designed for centralized generation, have to follow a different management approach when a big share of these technologies take part into the system. The space-time variability characteristics of solar radiation, wind and precipitation are very different and a detailed understanding of them is important for an adequate planning and management of the electricity system. This paper is focused on solar irradiation as source of energy for photovoltaic (PV) generation, but the proposed scheme can generally be applied to other renewable resources and different solar irradiation applications. A comprehensive methodology to analyze variability and complementarity of solar resource and PV production among sub-regions of a wide area is developed. The photovoltaic energy yield is defined as kWh per kW installed, which facilitates the comparison among sub-regions and allows a comparison with other renewable energies like solar thermoelectric or wind energy. The multi-step approach facilitates the spatial evaluation and comparison among areas and it could be applied to different time resolutions, from a short term analysis to climatological perspective as well as a climate change projections analysis. The main steps of the method are the application of an objective clustering method for performing a regionalization of the whole domain, the ana lysis of the temporal variability of solar radiation and photovoltaic energy yield, and the intercomparison of the obtained clusters for examining their complementarity. As an implementation example, we make use of 30 years of daily satellite data, which is usually considered as the time for defining a climatology, and a long-term overview of solar variability is analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). In this region, the internal interconnections of the electrical system are strong, but the external interconnections are rather limited. The spatial distribution and variability of photovoltaic (PV) power yield is calculated for different tracking systems. The variability is analyzed on an interannual time scale, which is relevant for energy supply security and year-to-year price stability. The interannual variability shows robustness and stability of solar radiation and PV production on average for the whole domain, but with significant differences among clusters that could allow spatial compensation of PV production. The relationship between the variability of solar irradiation and of PV yield is not uniform among the different clusters. Areas where solar irradiation is higher are more sensitive to tracking type. The whole process described in the article provides the information of how solar resource and the PV energy yield perform in a limited area and provide the tools to analyze the relationships between sub-areas and their variability. In this sense, this method can be applied for isolated or nearly isolated electric systems located in regions with a variety of climates, or for interconnected systems involving several countries.},

abstract = {The increase in the photovoltaic energy installed capacity over the world leads to the need of a better understanding of solar resource and its variability. The aim of this work is to assess the influence of aerosols on photovoltaic energy production from seasonal to multi-decadal time scales. For this purpose we use various coupled aerosol-climate simulations that take into account the complex spatial and temporal patterns of natural and anthropogenic aerosols over the Euro-Mediterranean domain. The results show that aerosols strongly influence the spatial pattern, seasonal cycle and long-term trend of PV production. The most affected area is Central Europe where sensitivity of PV production to aerosols is higher. The annual production loss due to aerosols ranges from no impact to -16{\%} in The Netherlands, with variation depending on the area and on the typology of the tracking system. The summer production loss can even reach -20{\%} over regions of Africa and Syria-Iraq. We conclude that aerosols cannot be neglected in the assessment of PV production at large time scales over the Euro-Mediterranean area. Besides, the potential increase in energy due to reduction in the anthropogenic aerosols is shown in the simulation of the brightening period over Europe, with an increase of 2000 kWhkWp in a PV lifetime for the most affected areas. It illustrates the evolution that PV potential could follow in highly polluted areas through the effective implementation of pollution control measures.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the Mediterranean Sea heat budget components from a set of forced and coupled simulations performed in the frame of the Med-CORDEX project. The simulations use regional climate system models (RCSMs) dedicated to the Mediterranean area and driven by the ERA40/ERA-Interim reanalyses. The study focuses on the period 1980--2010. Interannual variations of the average net heat flux at the sea surface are consistent among models but the spread in the mean values is large (from −4.8 to +2.2 Wm−2) with the coupled models showing the lowest heat loss from the sea. For the heat flux at the Strait of Gibraltar both interannual variations and mean values show a large intermodel spread. The basin average temperature shows positive trends with highest values in the coupled models; it also shows interannual variations that are in good agreement with observations. The heat content rate is calculated based on the derivative of the average temperature and is found to be significantly correlated for most models with the net heat flux at the sea surface (average correlation {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.5) but not with the net heat flux through the Strait of Gibraltar (average correlation {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.2), suggesting that in the considered RCSMs the interannual variability of the heat content rate is mainly driven by the surface heat fluxes. The resemblance between the simulated and observed heat content rates is stronger in the forced models than in the coupled ones. This is explained by the stronger constraint applied to the forced models by the use of the surface temperature relaxation to observations. The temperature of the outflowing water through the Strait of Gibraltar shows positive and significant trends, also higher in the coupled models. It is suggested that the Mediterranean Sea warming found in most models and in particular in the coupled ones, induces a change of the hydrographic conditions that affects the Strait of Gibraltar.},

This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.},

abstract = {AbstractThe land area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea has experienced 10 of the 12 driest winters since 1902 in just the last 20 years. A change in wintertime Mediterranean precipitation toward drier conditions has likely occurred over 1902–2010 whose magnitude cannot be reconciled with internal variability alone. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing are key attributable factors for this increased drying, though the external signal explains only half of the drying magnitude. Furthermore, sea surface temperature (SST) forcing during 1902–2010 likely played an important role in the observed Mediterranean drying, and the externally forced drying signal likely also occurs through an SST change signal.The observed wintertime Mediterranean drying over the last century can be understood in a simple framework of the region's sensitivity to a uniform global ocean warming and to modest changes in the ocean's zonal and meridional SST gradients. Climate models subjected to a uniform +0.5°C warming of the world oceans induce eastern Mediterranean drying but fail to generate the observed widespread Mediterranean drying pattern. For a +0.5°C SST warming confined to tropical latitudes only, a dry signal spanning the entire Mediterranean region occurs. The simulated Mediterranean drying intensifies further when the Indian Ocean is warmed +0.5°C more than the remaining tropical oceans, an enhanced drying signal attributable to a distinctive atmospheric circulation response resembling the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The extent to which these mechanisms and the region's overall drying since 1902 reflect similar mechanisms operating in association with external radiative forcing are discussed.},

The paper then describes a general methodology that is applicable to arbitrary PV fleets. A key input to this generalized approach is the correlation, or absence thereof, existing between individual installations in the fleet at the considered variability time scale. In this respect, the article includes a presentation of new experimental evidence from hourly satellite-derived irradiances relating distance and fluctuation time scales in three geographic regions in the United States (Southwest, Southern Great Plains, and Hawaii) and from recent high density network measurements that both confirm and extend conclusions from previous studies, namely: (1) correlation coefficients decrease predictably with increasing distance, (2) correlation coefficients decrease at a similar rate when evaluated versus distance divided by the considered variability time scale, and (3) the accuracy of results is improved by including an implied cloud speed term.},

The approach demonstrates that the relative power Output Variability for a fleet of identical PV systems (same size, orientation, and spacing) can be quantified by identifying the number of PV systems and their Dispersion Factor. The Dispersion Factor is a new variable that captures the relationship between PV Fleet configuration, Cloud Transit Speed, and the Time Interval over which variability is evaluated.

abstract = {In Ontario (Canada), the integration of renewable power is a priority policy goal. Since 2004, the circumstances under which the integration of renewable power is evaluated have changed due to successive changes in price as well as concerns that its over-production may add to grid congestion. This research investigates the value of increasing complementarity (both proximate and geographically dispersed) of wind and solar resources as a means by which electricity planners and researchers might advance electricity sustainability in Ontario. More specifically, this paper asks the following questions: 1) Does the combination of solar and wind resources in selected locations in Ontario serve to ‘smooth out' power production, i.e., decrease instances of both high and low values, as compared to either resource producing individually? 2) Can this ‘smoothness' be further improved by dispersing these resources geographically amongst locations? and 3) Does increasing the number of locations with solar and wind resources further ‘smooth out' power production? Three years (2003–2005) of synchronous, hourly measurements of solar irradiance and wind speeds from Environment Canada's Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) are used to derive dimensionless indices for four locations in Ontario (Toronto, Wiarton, Sault Ste. Marie and Ottawa). These indices are used to develop three transparent and accessible methods of analysis: (1) graphical representation; (2) percentile ranking; and (3) using a theoretical maximum as a proxy for capacity. The article concludes that the combination of solar and wind within locations and amongst two locations improves ‘smoothness' in power production, as compared to when each resource is produced on its own; moreover, it is further improved once more than two resources and two locations are combined. However, there is neither further benefit, nor drawback, associated with the geographic dispersion of complementarity between solar in one location and wind in another, when compared to both resources in one location.},

Recent development of weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS' Data Collection Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75{\%} of the Earth's surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90{\%} in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these measurements. The system's automatic data acquisition, transmission, and processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies, radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals. This article discusses the operation and philosophy of the monitoring system, the precision and accuracy of the measuring radiometers, a brief description of the processing system, and access to the database.},

abstract = {A new high-resolution regional climate change ensemble has been established for Europe within the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) initiative. The first set of simulations with a horizontal resolution of 12.5 km was completed for the new emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with more simulations expected to follow. The aim of this paper is to present this data set to the different communities active in regional climate modelling, impact assessment and adaptation. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble results have been compared to the SRES A1B simulation results achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns of changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in all three scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which can partly be related to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX. The results strengthen those obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need further investigations. The analysis of impact indices shows that for RCP8.5, there is a substantially larger change projected for temperature-based indices than for RCP4.5. The difference is less pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the increased resolution can be regarded as an added value of regional climate simulations. Regional climate model simulations provide higher daily precipitation intensities, which are completely missing in the global climate model simulations, and they provide a significantly different climate change of daily precipitation intensities resulting in a smoother shift from weak to moderate and high intensities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Renewable energies arise as part of both economic development plans and mitigation strategies aimed at abating climate change. Contrariwise, most renewable energies are potentially vulnerable to climate change, which could affect in particular solar and wind power. Proper evaluations of this two-way climate-renewable energy relationship require detailed information of the geographical location of the renewable energy fleets. However, this information is usually provided as total amounts installed per administrative region, especially with respect to future planned installations. To help overcome this limiting issue, the objective of this contribution was to develop the so-called CLIMIX model: a tool that performs a realistic spatial allocation of given amounts of both photovoltaic (PV) and wind power installed capacities and evaluates the energy generated under varying climate conditions. This is done over a regular grid so that the created scenarios can be directly used in conjunction with outputs of climate models. First, we used the 0.44° resolution grid defined for the EURO-CORDEX project and applied the CLIMIX model to spatially allocate total amounts of both unreported 2012 and future 2020 PV and wind power installations in Europe at the country level. Second, we performed a validation exercise using the various options for estimating PV and wind power production under the created scenarios that are included in the model. The results revealed an acceptable agreement between the estimated and the recorded power production values in every European country. Lastly, we estimated increases in power production derived from the future deployment of new renewable units, often obtaining non-direct relationships. This latter further emphasizes the need of accurate spatially-resolved PV and wind power scenarios in order to perform reliable estimations of power production.},

For that we adopted regional and continental perspectives (assuming a single European electricity grid), considered several temporal frequencies (from daily to annual), used state-of-the-art regional climate projections together with a climate-production model, and assumed a future massive deployment of wind and PV power installations. Results support that the spatio-temporal complementarity between the wind and solar resources helps to minimize the temporal variability of the combined production under both present (1971–2000) and future (2070–2099) climate conditions similarly. Thus the projected changes are overall negligible (well below ±5{\%}). However, an additional assessment of theoretical upper/bottom bounds for these changes indicated significant potential increases in the stability of the joint production ranging from 5 to 25{\%} across regions, 15{\%} at the continental scale. This would be subordinated to the feasibility of reaching, with the future deployment strategies, individual wind and PV power production series with a perfect temporal anticorrelation. These results may encourage stakeholders to take holistically optimized decisions.},

Res. Lett. 8 044035 Abstract The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA) and the Scandinavian (SCAND) modes are the three main large-scale circulation patterns driving the climate variability of the Iberian Peninsula. This study assesses their influence in terms of solar (photovoltaic) and wind power generation potential (SP and WP) and evaluates their skill as predictors. For that we use a hindcast regional climate simulation to retrieve the primary meteorological variables involved, surface solar radiation and wind speed. First we identify that the maximum influence of the various modes occurs on the interannual variations of the monthly mean SP and WP series, being generally more relevant in winter. Second we find that in this time-scale and season, SP (WP) varies up to 30{\%} (40{\%}) with respect to the mean climatology between years with opposite phases of the modes, although the strength and the spatial distribution of the signals differ from one month to another. Last, the skill of a multi-linear regression model (MLRM), built using the NAO, EA and SCAND indices, to reconstruct the original wintertime monthly series of SP and WP was investigated. The reconstructed series (when the MLRM is calibrated for each month individually) correlate with the original ones up to 0.8 at the interannual time-scale. Besides, when the modeled series for each individual month are merged to construct an October-to-March monthly series, and after removing the annual cycle in order to account for monthly anomalies, these correlate 0.65 (0.55) with the original SP (WP) series in average. These values remain fairly stable when the calibration and reconstruction periods differ, thus supporting up to a point the predictive potential of the method at the time-scale assessed here.},

abstract = {Europe is investing considerably in renewable energies for a sustainable future, with both Iberian countries (Portugal and Spain) promoting significantly new hydropower, wind, and solar plants. The climate variability in this area is highly controlled by just a few large-scale teleconnection modes. However, the relationship between these modes and the renewable climate-dependent energy resources has not yet been established in detail. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the interannual variability of the main and primary renewable energy resources in Iberia. This is achieved through a holistic assessment that is based on a 10-km-resolution climate simulation spanning the period 1959–2007 that provides physically consistent data of the various magnitudes involved. A monthly analysis for the ex- tended winter (October–March) months shows that negativeNAOphases enhance wind speeds (10{\%}–15{\%}) and, thereby, wind power (estimated around 30{\%} at typical wind-turbine altitudes) and hydropower re- sources (with changes in precipitation exceeding 100{\%} and implying prolonged responses in reservoir storage and release throughout the year), while diminishing the solar potential (10{\%}–20{\%}). Opposite signals were also sporadically identified, being well explained when taking into account the orography and the prevailing wind direction during bothNAOphases.Anadditional analysis using real wind, hydropower, and solar power generation data further confirms the strong signature of the NAO.},

abstract = {The analysis of the influence of future climatic variations on air quality needs of methods that give a space-time display of large atmospheric data related to air pollution. Here a new approach in order to assess the impacts of climate change on the patterns of variation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) over Europe is presented. The most widely used method of analysis (selected time-slices, future-minus-present method) is very sensitive to the chosen control and future periods because of the internal variability of the climate system. In order to overcome this limitation, full transient simulations for the period 1991-2100 under the SRES A2 scenario are analysed by the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) methodology in order minimise the uncertainty associated to the internal variability due to the longer time series obtained. The results indicate that the EOF1 accounts for around 30-45{\%} of the total variance for the SIA levels and points out a general increase of its trend over the entire domain (p{\textless} 0.005), except in the case of nitrate, whose change signal is not significant (p{\textgreater} 0.1). The correlation between SIA and meteorological parameters indicates that the trends and patterns of variation of aerosols are related to the higher temperature projected for the future climate. It favours the formation of sulphates and ammonium (increasing the concentrations of atmospheric oxidants) and the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the decreases in precipitation have a strong effect on the frequency of the washout and therefore in the levels of aerosols. The concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. The trend from a decreasing mixing height found in several areas of Europe is frequently related to a decrease in precipitation, representing an adding effect for the enhanced future SIA concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change alone influences future air pollution levels through modifications of gas-phase chemistry, transport, removal, and natural emissions. Hence, the goal of this study is to determine at what extent concentrations of air pollutants respond to changes over the Iberian Peninsula under a climate change scenario. The methodology includes the use of the regional modeling system MM5 (regional climate model version)-CHIMERE for two nested domains covering Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. Two time slices driven by ECHO-G global circulation model covering from 1991 to 2010 and 2071 to 2100 under the SRES A2 scenario have been compared. Climate change influences the concentrations of both gas-phase pollutants and aerosols through changes in temperature, precipitation, mixing height, transport, humidity, and oxidant levels. The trends of variation of ozone (changes up to 5 ppb, +10{\%} increase during summertime) and aerosols over southwestern Europe are influenced by the higher mean temperature modeled for the future climate (up to +5.4 K), since it favors the formation of secondary gas-phase products. It also enhances sulphates (+2 $\mu$g m-3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) (+2.5 $\mu$g m-3under SRES A2 scenario) and contributes to the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the 17{\%} percent decrease of precipitation modeled for 2071-2100 has a strong effect in the frequency of the washout and therefore in the levels of natural aerosols: the concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ten-year (1964–1973) continuous records at Hamburg of hourly sums of solar and terrestrial, downward and upward radiation flux densities have been evaluated with regard to simultaneous hourly cloud observations. The irradiance at given solar elevation is plotted vs total cloud amount for each season and for the whole year; in the same way, the ratio of the irradiance under clouded to that under cloudless sky is presented. Additional diagrams show the irradiance under cloudless and under overcast sky as function of solar elevation. The ratio of global radiation at total cloud amount N okta, G(N), to global radiation at cloudless sky, G(0), at the same solar elevation $\gamma$ turned out to be indepenent of $\gamma$ and can be parameterized by G(N)G(0) = 1 − 0.75(N8)3.4. The influence of cloud type is demonstrated by diagrams showing the irradiance under skies overcast by a specific cloud type as function of solar elevation for each season and for the year; also, the corresponding ratios “overcast” to “cloudless” are presented. In the case of global radiation, the ratios G(8)G(0) which may be interpreted as the transmittances of the specific cloud types for global radiation, turned out to be independent of solar elevation and have the following mean values: Ci, Cc, Cs 0.61; Ac, As 0.27; Sc, Cu 0.25; St 0.18; Ns 0.16.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosols are intricately linked to the climate system and to the hydrologic cycle. The net effect of aerosols is to cool the climate system by reflecting sunlight. Depending on their composition, aerosols can also absorb sunlight in the atmosphere, further cooling the surface but warming the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on the temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei, impact the hydrologic cycle, through changes in cloud cover, cloud properties and precipitation. Unravelling these feedbacks is particularly difficult because aerosols take a multitude of shapes and forms, ranging from desert dust to urban pollution, and because aerosol concentrations vary strongly over time and space. To accurately study aerosol distribution and composition therefore requires continuous observations from satellites, networks of ground-based instruments and dedicated field experiments. Increases in aerosol concentration and changes in their composition, driven by industrialization and an expanding population, may adversely affect the Earth's climate and water supply.},

abstract = {We use the global atmospheric GCM aerosol model ECHAM5-HAM to asses possible impacts of future air pollution mitigation strategies on climate. Air quality control strategies focus on the reduction of aerosol emissions. Here we investigate the extreme case of a maximum feasible end-of-pipe abatement of aerosols in the near term future (2030) in combination with increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. The temperature response of increasing GHG concentrations and reduced aerosol emissions leads to a global annual mean equilibrium temperature response of 2.18 K. When aerosols are maximally abated only in the Industry and Powerplant sector, while other sectors stay with currently enforced regulations, the temperature response is 1.89 K. A maximum feasible abatement applied in the Domestic and Transport sector, while other sectors remain with the current legislation, leads to a temperature response of 1.39 K. Increasing GHG concentrations alone lead to a temperature response of 1.20 K. We also simulate 2--5{\%} increases in global mean precipitation among all scenarios considered, and the hydrological sensitivity is found to be significantly higher for aerosols than for GHGs. Our study, thus highlights the huge potential impact of future air pollution mitigation strategies on climate and supports the need for urgent GHG emission reductions. GHG and aerosol forcings are not independent as both affect and are influenced by changes in the hydrological cycle. However, within the given range of changes in aerosol emissions and GHG concentrations considered in this study, the climate response towards increasing GHG concentrations and decreasing aerosols emissions is additive.},

abstract = {The Earth?s radiation budget is essential for driving the general circulation of the atmosphere and ocean, and for building the main conditions for the Earth's climate system. To detect changes in the Earth?s surface radiation field the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and its central archive - the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) - was created in 1992. BSRN is a project of the Radiation Panel (now the Data and Assessment Panel) from the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) under the umbrella of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). It is the global baseline network for surface radiation for the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), contributing to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW), and forming a cooperative network with the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The data are of primary importance in supporting the validation and confirmation of satellite and computer model estimates. At a relatively small number of stations (currently 58) in contrasting climatic zones, solar and atmospheric radiation is measured with instruments of the highest available accuracy and with high temporal resolution (mainly 1 minute). A total of about 7000 station-month datasets were available in the WRMC in mid 2013. All data are interactively accessible to external users for bona fide research purposes at no cost. This report provides information for scientists interested in high quality surface radiation data as well as for scientists running a BSRN station. It offers information about the available data, the data access and describes tools to visualize the data and to check their quality.},

Consequently, AvWS in SLE is featured by a prolonged bleeding time and normal platelet count, a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and normal prothrombin time (PT), decreased or absent ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA), and type II vWF deficiency on multimeric analysis of the vWF protein. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome type II in SLE responds poorly to 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) and FVIII concentrate, but responds transiently well to high-dose gammaglobulin given intravenously. All reported cases of AvWS in SLE were cured by appropriate treatment of the underlying autoimmune disease with prednisone or immunosuppression.},

abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation is expanding rapidly in China, with total capacity projected to be 400 GW by 2030. However, severe aerosol pollution over China reduces solar radiation reaching the surface. We estimate the aerosol impact on solar PV electricity generation at the provincial and regional grid levels in China. Our approach is to examine the 12-year (2003–2014) average reduction in point-of-array irradiance (POAI) caused by aerosols in the atmosphere. We apply satellite-derived surface irradiance data from the NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) with a PV performance model (PVLIB-Python) to calculate the impact of aerosols and clouds on POAI. Our findings reveal that aerosols over northern and eastern China, the most polluted regions, reduce annual average POAI by up to 1.5 kWh/m2 per day relative to pollution-free conditions, a decrease of up to 35{\%}. Annual average reductions of POAI over both northern and eastern China are about 20–25{\%}. We also evaluate the seasonal variability of the impact and find that aerosols in this region are as important as clouds in winter. Furthermore, we find that aerosols decrease electricity output of tracking PV systems more than those with fixed arrays: over eastern China, POAI is reduced by 21{\%} for fixed systems at optimal angle and 34{\%} for two-axis tracking systems. We conclude that PV system performance in northern and eastern China will benefit from improvements in air quality and will facilitate that improvement by providing emission-free electricity.},

abstract = {The contribution of power production from PV systems to the electricity supply is constantly increasing. An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production, as a basis for management of the electricity grids and trading on the energy market. We present and evaluate the regional PV power prediction system of University of Oldenburg and Meteocontrol GmbH providing forecasts of up to 2 days ahead with hourly resolution. The proposed approach is based on forecasts of the global model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF). It includes a post-processing procedure to derive optimised, site-specific irradiance forecasts and explicit physical modelling steps to convert the predicted irradiances to PV power. Finally, regional power forecasts are derived by up-scaling from a representative set of PV systems. The investigation of proper up-scaling is a special focus of this paper. We introduce a modified up-scaling approach, modelling the spatial distribution of the nominal power with a resolution of 18?18. The operational PV power prediction system is evaluated in comparison to the modified up-scaling approach for the control areas of the two German transmission system operators ‘transpower' and ‘50 Hertz' for the period 2.7.2009–30.4.2010. rmse values of the operational forecasts are in the range of 4–5{\%} with respect to the nominal power for intra-day and day-ahead forecast horizons. Further improvement is achieved with the modified up- scaling approach. Copyright {\#} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The paper reviews different approaches, technologies, and strategies to manage large-scale schemes of variable renewable electricity such as solar and wind power. We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different "P2Y"-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To "functionalize" or to assess the value of the various energy system flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be promising.},

abstract = {Abstract. The Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment (ChArMEx; http://charmex.lsce.ipsl.fr) is a collaborative research program federating international activities to investigate Mediterranean regional chemistry-climate interactions. A special observing period (SOP-1a) including intensive airborne measurements was performed in the framework of the Aerosol Direct Radiative Impact on the regional climate in the MEDiterranean region (ADRIMED) project during the Mediterranean dry season over the western and central Mediterranean basins, with a focus on aerosol-radiation measurements and their modeling. The SOP-1a took place from 11 June to 5 July 2013. Airborne measurements were made by both the ATR-42 and F-20 French research aircraft operated from Sardinia (Italy) and instrumented for in situ and remote-sensing measurements, respectively, and by sounding and drifting balloons, launched in Minorca. The experimental setup also involved several ground-based measurement sites on islands including two ground-based reference stations in Corsica and Lampedusa and secondary monitoring sites in Minorca and Sicily. Additional measurements including lidar profiling were also performed on alert during aircraft operations at EARLINET/ACTRIS stations at Granada and Barcelona in Spain, and in southern Italy. Remote-sensing aerosol products from satellites (MSG/SEVIRI, MODIS) and from the AERONET/PHOTONS network were also used. Dedicated meso-scale and regional modeling experiments were performed in relation to this observational effort. We provide here an overview of the different surface and aircraft observations deployed during the ChArMEx/ADRIMED period and of associated modeling studies together with an analysis of the synoptic conditions that determined the aerosol emission and transport. Meteorological conditions observed during this campaign (moderate temperatures and southern flows) were not favorable to producing high levels of atmospheric pollutants or intense biomass burning events in the region. However, numerous mineral dust plumes were observed during the campaign, with the main sources located in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, leading to aerosol optical depth (AOD) values ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 (at 440nm) over the western and central Mediterranean basins. One important point of this experiment concerns the direct observations of aerosol extinction onboard the ATR-42, using the CAPS system, showing local maxima reaching up to 150M m−1 within the dust plume. Non-negligible aerosol extinction (about 50M m−1) has also been observed within the marine boundary layer (MBL). By combining the ATR-42 extinction coefficient observations with absorption and scattering measurements, we performed a complete optical closure revealing excellent agreement with estimated optical properties. This additional information on extinction properties has allowed calculation of the dust single scattering albedo (SSA) with a high level of confidence over the western Mediterranean. Our results show a moderate variability from 0.90 to 1.00 (at 530nm) for all flights studied compared to that reported in the literature on this optical parameter. Our results underline also a relatively low difference in SSA with values derived near dust sources. In parallel, active remote-sensing observations from the surface and onboard the F-20 aircraft suggest a complex vertical structure of particles and distinct aerosol layers with sea spray and pollution located within the MBL, and mineral dust and/or aged North American smoke particles located above (up to 6–7km in altitude). Aircraft and balloon-borne observations allow one to investigate the vertical structure of the aerosol size distribution showing particles characterized by a large size ({\textgreater} 10µm in diameter) within dust plumes. In most of cases, a coarse mode characterized by an effective diameter ranging between 5 and 10µm, has been detected above the MBL. In terms of shortwave (SW) direct forcing, in situ surface and aircraft observations have been merged and used as inputs in 1-D radiative transfer codes for calculating the aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF). Results show significant surface SW instantaneous forcing (up to −90W m−2 at noon). Aircraft observations provide also original estimates of the vertical structure of SW and LW radiative heating revealing significant instantaneous values of about 5°K per day in the solar spectrum (for a solar angle of 30°) within the dust layer. Associated 3-D modeling studies from regional climate (RCM) and chemistry transport (CTM) models indicate a relatively good agreement for simulated AOD compared with observations from the AERONET/PHOTONS network and satellite data, especially for long-range dust transport. Calculations of the 3-D SW (clear-sky) surface DRF indicate an average of about −10 to −20W m−2 (for the whole period) over the Mediterranean Sea together with maxima (−50W m−2) over northern Africa. The top of the atmosphere (TOA) DRF is shown to be highly variable within the domain, due to moderate absorbing properties of dust and changes in the surface albedo. Indeed, 3-D simulations indicate negative forcing over the Mediterranean Sea and Europe and positive forcing over northern Africa. Finally, a multi-year simulation, performed for the 2003 to 2009 period and including an ocean–atmosphere (O–A) coupling, underlines the impact of the aerosol direct radiative forcing on the sea surface temperature, O–A fluxes and the hydrological cycle over the Mediterranean.},

Key device characteristics were compiled, including light/dark J–V, quantum efficiency, temperature dependence of Voc and series resistance, photoluminescence, and capacitance spectroscopy, providing important insight into how the devices compare with high-performance Cu(In,Ga)Se2. The record kesterite device was shown to be primarily limited by interface recombination, minority carrier lifetime, and series resistance. The new level of device performance points to the significant promise of the kesterites as an emerging and commercially interesting thin-film technology.

The forecasting approach uses information gathered from satellite image analysis including velocimetry and cloud indexing as inputs to the ANN models. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first attempt to hybridize stochastic learning and image processing approaches for solar irradiance forecasting.

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) modules in real operation present angular losses in reference to their behaviour in standard test conditions, due to the angle of incidence of the incident radiation and the surface soil. Although these losses are not always negligible, they are commonly not taken into account when correcting the electrical characteristics of the PV module or estimating the energy production of PV systems. The main reason of this approximation is the lack of easy-to-use mathematical expressions for the angular losses calculation. This paper analyses these losses on PV modules and presents an analytical model based on theoretical and experimental results. The proposed model fits monocrystalline as well as polycrystalline and amorphous silicon PV modules, and contemplates the existence of superficial dust. With it angular losses integrated over time periods of interest can be easily calculated. Monthly and annual losses have been calculated for 10 different European sites, having diverse climates and latitudes (ranging from 32?? to 52??), and considering different module tilt angles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The contribution of clouds and aerosols to the decadal variations of downward surface shortwave radiation (SSR) is a current controversial topic. This study proposes a method, which is based on surface-based SSR measurements, aerosol observations, and radiative transfer simulations (in cloud-free and cloud- and aerosol-free scenarios), to evaluate cloud-aerosol (CARE), cloud (CRE), and aerosol (ARE) radiative effects. This method is applied to quantify the role played by, separately, clouds and aerosols on the intense brightening of the SSR observed in the Iberian Peninsula. Clouds and Earth's Radiation Energy Budget System (CERES) and surface-based data exhibit an increase in SSR between 2003 and 2012, exceeding +10 Wm-2 over this period for some areas of the peninsula. The calculations are performed for three surface-based sites: Barcelona and Valladolid (Spain), and {\'{E}}vora (Portugal). Ranges in monthly values of CARE, CRE, and ARE are (-80, -20), (-60, -20), and (-30,0), respectively (in W m-2). The average trends for the analyzed period of CARE, CRE, and ARE are +7, +5, and +2 Wm-2 per decade, respectively. Overall, three fourths of the SSR trend is explained by clouds, while the other one fourth is related to aerosol changes. The SSR trends explained by the clouds and aerosol radiative effects are in line with the observed reductions in total cloud cover and aerosol load (both at the surface and in the whole atmospheric column). Furthermore, the CRE values are compared against CERES data showing good agreement between both data series, although some discrepancies are observed in their trends.},

abstract = {The environmental and economical merits of converting solar energy into electricity via photovoltaic cells have caused an ever increasing interest among developed and developing countries to allocate more budget on photovoltaic systems in order to boost up their efficiency in recent years. Besides the material and design parameters, there are several omnipresent factors such as dust, humidity and air velocity that can influence the PV cell's performance. There have been a handful of studies conducted on the effect of various influential parameters on the efficiency and performance of photovoltaic cells; however none has taken all these three parameters into account simultaneously. In this study the impact of dust accumulation, humidity level and the air velocity will be elaborated separately and finally the impact of each on the other will be clarified. It is shown that each of these three factors affect the other two and it is concluded that in order to have a profound insight of solar cell design, the effect of these factors should be taken into consideration in parallel. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas and are becoming more popular nowadays. They can learn from examples, are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data, are able to deal with nonlinear problems and once trained can perform prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being developed and deployed worldwide in a wide variety of applications, mainly because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation capabilities. AI has been used in different sectors, such as engineering, economics, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting and control of complex systems. The paper outlines an understanding of how AI systems operate by way of presenting a number of problems in photovoltaic systems application.

abstract = {Abstract. Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In parallel, AOD climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of this unique multi-year database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, sea-salt, sulfate, black and organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products: NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS, ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth-Probe) and METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4, the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS and MACC. Ground-based Level-2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this region, showing a relevant spatio-temporal variability and highlighting high dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the 2003–2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations, which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology. We extend the 2003–2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the 2003–2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosol-climate studies.},

abstract = {Since the 1980s anthropogenic aerosols have been considerably reduced in Europe and the Mediterranean area. This decrease is often considered as the likely cause of the brightening effect observed over the same period. This phenomenon is however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain 81 ± 16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the surface warming simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct aerosol effect is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated brightening. The comparison between regional simulations and homogenized ground-based observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the realistic aerosol variations.},

abstract = {A fully coupled regional climate system model (CNRM-RCSM4) has been used over the Mediterranean region to investigate the direct and semi-direct effects of aerosols, but also their role in the radiation--atmosphere--ocean interactions through multi-annual ensemble simulations (2003--2009) with and without aerosols and ocean--atmosphere coupling. Aerosols have been taken into account in CNRM-RCSM4 through realistic interannual monthly AOD climatologies. An evaluation of the model has been achieved, against various observations for meteorological parameters, and has shown the ability of CNRM-RCSM4 to reproduce the main patterns of the Mediterranean climate despite some biases in sea surface temperature (SST), radiation and cloud cover. The results concerning the aerosol radiative effects show a negative surface forcing on average because of the absorption and scattering of the incident radiation. The SW surface direct effect is on average −20.9 Wm−2 over the Mediterranean Sea, −14.7 Wm−2 over Europe and −19.7 Wm−2 over northern Africa. The LW surface direct effect is weaker as only dust aerosols contribute (+4.8 Wm−2 over northern Africa). This direct effect is partly counterbalanced by a positive semi-direct radiative effect over the Mediterranean Sea (+5.7 Wm−2 on average) and Europe (+5.0 Wm−2) due to changes in cloud cover and atmospheric circulation. The total aerosol effect is consequently negative at the surface and responsible for a decrease in land (on average −0.4 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C over Europe, and −0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C over northern Africa) and sea surface temperature (on average −0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C for the Mediterranean SST). In addition, the latent heat loss is shown to be weaker (−11.0 Wm−2) in the presence of aerosols, resulting in a decrease in specific humidity in the lower troposphere, and a reduction in cloud cover and precipitation. Simulations also indicate that dust aerosols warm the troposphere by absorbing solar radiation, and prevent radiation from reaching the surface, thus stabilizing the troposphere. The comparison with the model response in atmosphere-only simulations shows that these feedbacks are attenuated if SST cannot be modified by aerosols, highlighting the importance of using coupled regional models over the Mediterranean. Oceanic convection is also strengthened by aerosols, which tends to reinforce the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. In parallel, two case studies are presented to illustrate positive feedbacks between dust aerosols and regional climate. First, the eastern Mediterranean was subject to high dust aerosol loads in June 2007 which reduce land and sea surface temperature, as well as air--sea humidity fluxes. Because of northern wind over the eastern Mediterranean, drier and cooler air has been consequently advected from the sea to the African continent, reinforcing the direct dust effect over land. On the contrary, during the western European heat wave in June 2006, dust aerosols have contributed to reinforcing an important ridge responsible for dry and warm air advection over western Europe, and thus to increasing lower troposphere (+0.8 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C) and surface temperature (+0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C), namely about 15 {\{}{\%}{\}} of this heat wave.},

abstract = {We examine multidecadal changes in surface downward shortwave (SW) radiation flux, total cloud cover, SW cloud effect, and related parameters over Europe during 1965{\&}{\#}8211;2004 using monthly gridded data from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), synoptic cloud reports, and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). One key issue is distinguishing the effects of natural cloud variability from long-term anthropogenic aerosol influences on surface SW flux. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of cloud cover radiative effect (CCRE), defined as the change in downward SW flux produced by a change in cloud cover. The correlation between pan-European time series of CCRE anomalies and GEBA solar radiation anomalies is 0.88, indicating that cloud cover variability and associated changes in cloud albedo dominate SW radiation variability on monthly to decadal timescales. After these weather-related cloud effects are removed by subtracting CCRE anomalies from GEBA solar radiation anomalies via linear regression, a distinct decreasing trend followed by a distinct increasing trend remain in the residual time series. Depending on the method of trend calculation, pan-European residual flux declined by a statistically significant 2.7{\&}{\#}8211;3.5 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2 per decade during 1971{\&}{\#}8211;1986 and rose by a statistically significant 2.0{\&}{\#}8211;2.3 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2 per decade during 1987{\&}{\#}8211;2002. The fact that independent grid boxes exhibit mostly negative trends in the earlier period and mostly positive trends in the later period demonstrates that these long-term variations in SW flux are real and widespread over Europe. Changes in cloud cover cannot account for the trends in surface SW flux since cloud cover actually slightly decreased during 1971{\&}{\#}8211;1986 and slightly increased during 1987{\&}{\#}8211;2002. The most likely explanation is changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions that led to more scattering and absorption of SW radiation during the earlier period of solar {\&}{\#}8220;dimming{\&}{\#}8221; and less scattering and absorption during the later period of solar {\&}{\#}8220;brightening.{\&}{\#}8221;},

abstract = { To support climate research, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) initiated a new radiometric network, the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). The network aims at providing validation material for satellite radiometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term variations in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play an important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN, consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S, and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to scientific communities in various ways depending on the communication environment of the users. The present article discusses the scientific base, organizational and technical aspects of the network, and data retrieval methods; shows various application possibilities; and presents the future tasks to be accomplished. }

abstract = {Ideally, one needs long-term time series of solar-radiation data and temperature data for each specific site at the hourly level. Such data are relatively rare, so in recent years statistical approaches have been developed to help fill the gap. Long series of daily data are needed for sizing and modeling of stand-alone systems. Effective statistical approaches have to recognize the links between solar-radiation data and temperature data. Solar-radiation data are often presented in a dimensionless form called the clearness index. The experience gained in the production of European Solar Radiation Atlas 2000 has indicated the great importance of having daily time series of global radiation for making sensibly reliable design decisions. Otherwise, the day-to-day variability patterns in solar radiation due to weather change will be lost. The daily global radiation can be profiled to match the clear-day profile to estimate hourly irradiation values with an acceptable loss in accuracy. The monthly mean values cannot be used with accuracy to simulate daily profiles.},

Accurate climate information is essential for the conditions of solar energy production, maximization, and stable regulation and planning. Climate change impacts on energy output projections are thus of crucial importance. In this study the effect of projected changes in irradiance and temperature on the performance of photovoltaic systems in Greece is examined. Climate projections were obtained from 5 regional climate models (RCMs) under the A1B emissions scenario, for two future periods. The RCM data present systematic errors against observed values, resulting in the need of bias adjustment. The projected change in photovoltaic energy output was then estimated, considering changes in temperature and insolation. The spatiotemporal analysis indicates significant increase in mean annual temperature (up to 3.5°C) and mean total radiation (up to 5 W/m 2 ) by 2100. The performance of photovoltaic systems exhibits a negative linear dependence on the projected temperature increase which is outweighed by the expected increase of total radiation resulting in an up to 4{\%} increase in energy output.},

abstract = {The energy produced by a photovoltaic system over a given period can be estimated from the incident radiation at the site where the Grid Connected PV System (GCPVS) is located, assuming knowledge of certain basic features of the system under study. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of solar radiation, the question "How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this location over the next few years?" involves an exercise of prediction inevitably subjected to a degree of uncertainty. Moreover, during the life cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: "Is the system working correctly?". This paper proposes and examines several methods to cope with these questions. The daily performance of a PV system is simulated. This simulation and the interannual variability of both radiation and productivity are statistically analyzed. From the results several regression adjustments are obtained. This analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity prediction and performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical analysis of the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method of malfunctioning parts of the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The use of real electrical power time series from a large collection of photovoltaic inverters of a same plant is an important contribution in the context of models built upon simplified assumptions to overcome the absence of such data. This data set is divided into three different fluctuation categories with a clustering procedure which performs correctly with the clearness index and the wavelet variances. Afterwards, the time dependent correlation between the electrical power time series of the inverters is estimated with the wavelet transform. The wavelet correlation depends on the distance between the inverters, the wavelet time scales and the daily fluctuation level. Correlation values for time scales below one minute are low without dependence on the daily fluctuation level. For time scales above 20min, positive high correlation values are obtained, and the decay rate with the distance depends on the daily fluctuation level. At intermediate time scales the correlation depends strongly on the daily fluctuation level. The proposed methods have been implemented using free software.

abstract = {Abstract. Solar radiation is the main driver of the Earth's climate. Measuring solar radiation and analysing its interaction with clouds are essential for the understanding of the climate system. The EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) generates satellite-based, high-quality climate data records, with a focus on the energy balance and water cycle. Here, multiple of these data records are analyzed in a common framework to assess the consistency in trends and spatio-temporal variability of surface solar radiation, top-of-atmosphere reflected solar radiation and cloud fraction. This multi-parameter analysis focuses on Europe and covers the time period from 1992 to 2015. A high correlation between these three variables has been found over Europe. An overall consistency of the climate data records reveals an increase of surface solar radiation and a decrease in top-of-atmosphere reflected radiation. In addition, those trends are confirmed by negative trends in cloud cover. This consistency documents the high quality and stability of the CM SAF climate data records, which are mostly derived independently from each other. The results of this study indicate that one of the main reasons for the positive trend in surface solar radiation since the 1990's is a decrease in cloud coverage even if an aerosol contribution cannot be completely ruled out.},

abstract = {Abstract The incoming solar radiation is the essential climate variable that determines the Earth's energy cycle and climate. As long-term high-quality surface measurements of solar radiation are rare, satellite data are used to derive more information on its spatial pattern and its temporal variability. Recently, the EUMETSAT Satellite Application on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) has published two satellite-based climate data records: Surface Solar Radiation Data Set-Heliosat, Edition 2 (SARAH-2), and Clouds and Radiation Data Set based on AVHRR (advanced very high resolution radiometer) Satellite Measurements, Edition 2 (CLARA-A2). Both data records provide estimates of surface solar radiation. In this study, these new climate data records are compared to surface measurements in Europe during the period 1983–2015. SARAH-2 and CLARA-A2 show a high accuracy compared to ground-based observations (mean absolute deviations of 6.9 and 7.3 W/m2, respectively) highlighting a good agreement considering the temporal behavior and the spatial distribution. The results show an overall brightening period since the 1980s onward (comprised between 1.9 and 2.4 W/m2/decade), with substantial decadal and spatial variability. The strongest brightening is found in eastern Europe in spring. An exception is found for northern and southern Europe, where the trends shown by the station data are not completely reproduced by satellite data, especially in summer in southern Europe. We conclude that the major part of the observed trends in surface solar radiation in Europe is caused by changes in clouds and that remaining differences between the satellite- and the station-based data might be connected to changes in the direct aerosol effect and in snow cover.},

abstract = {This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of satellite-based methods for deriving solar irradiance components for analyzing the impact of the external inputs that are normally associated to the satellite model. Different sensitivity calculations have been performed using as reference site the PSA (Solar Platform of Almeria) station placed at the south-east of Spain. Thus, the sensitivity to the aerosol information input has been addressed by comparing the estimations using aerosol input from AERONET data with those using aerosol dataset such as MODIS or MISR (based on satellite) and MACC (based on reanalysis). Sensitivity to the clear sky model choice has been also studied by using three different models, from the simpler ESRA model (in terms of input parameters) to the most sophisticated REST2. Finally, three global to direct conversion models (Louche, DirInt and DirIndex) have been included to explore the sensitivity of the direct normal irradiance estimations. The sensitivity analysis has shown the interrelations between the different cases according to the uncertainty of the input information used. The results have been analyzed for clear and non-clear sky conditions separately and for the DNI irradiance range of 400–900 W m−2 as a case of special interest for the concentrating solar power applications. The work presented here has as novelty the analysis of the propagation of uncertainty of individual models and atmospheric datasets in the framework of a satellite-based model for solar irradiance computation and their relative weights to the final performance of the model. An underestimation of AOD by 50{\%} causes an error in the global horizontal irradiance calculated by a clear sky model of 3–5{\%} depending on the model used, and slightly less for an overestimation of AOD. For DNI the error ranges are 12–15{\%} and 9–12{\%} for 50{\%} underestimation and overestimation of AOD respectively.},

To assess this risk, statistical methods may be applied either before the system simulation (e.g. to create solar resource data in terms of exceedance probabilities such a P50 or P90) or on the system performance to determine the likelihood that a power plant will generate a certain amount of energy in any given year over the plant's life (e.g. the P50 or P90 annual productions). This paper presents and illustrates the long-term analysis of four CSP plants (parabolic trough and central receiver technology) in four sites within the Mediterranean and North Africa region; the analysis includes the exceedance probabilities estimations. Satellite-derived data for 20 years have been used for solar resource datasets in hourly basis, and multiyear simulations of the plant output have been performed with System Advisor Model. The associated uncertainties have been included in the long-term analysis of both DNI and CSP plant production.

abstract = {Solar surface irradiance (SIS) and direct (SID) irradiance as well as effective cloud albedo (CAL) climate data records (CDR) derived from the Meteosat first generation satellites (Meteosats 2 to 7, 1983-2005) are presented. The CDRs are available free of charge for all purposes from wui.cmsaf.eu at monthly, daily and hourly means at a spatial resolution of 0.03.The processing employed a climate version of the Heliosat algorithm combined with a clear sky model using an eigenvector look-up table method. Modifications to the Heliosat method include a self-calibration algorithm as well as a running mean based clear sky retrieval algorithm.The datasets are validated using ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) as a reference. The validation threshold for the mean absolute bias between satellite-derived and surface-measured radiation is given by the target accuracy for solar irradiance fields defined by the Global Climate Observing system (GCOS) and a measurement uncertainty for the surface data. The results demonstrate that the target accuracy is achieved for monthly and daily means. Furthermore, an intercomparison with similar datasets reveal a better performance and climate monitoring potential of the CM SAF SIS CDR at most BSRN sites compared to established data sets like e.g. ERA-reanalysis, GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project). Lastly, the realistic representation of both seasonal and inter-annual variability guarantees the applicability of the satellite-based climate data sets for climate monitoring and analysis of extremes.No trends in the normalized bias between the CM SAF and the BSRN datasets are detectable, which demonstrates the stability and homogeneity of the global and direct irradiance for the period covered by BSRN measurements. However, inconsistencies are detectable at few satellite transition dates for certain regions in earlier years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In this study, short term variability in power output due to changing intensity due to cloud cover is assessed for its impact on energy delivery. Studies on this subject conclude that while there may be local variability, there is a strong reduction in that variability when the aggregate of several PV systems is taken into account, rather than just one PV system. The analysis shows that the aggregated effect of many geographically dispersed systems PV systems yields a smoothing effect that reduces the impact of local variability.},

abstract = {The importance for reliable forecasts of incoming solar radiation is growing rapidly, especially for those countries with an increasing share in photovoltaic (PV) power production. The reliability of solar radiation forecasts depends mainly on the representation of clouds and aerosol particles absorbing and scattering radiation. Especially under extreme aerosol conditions, numerical weather prediction has a systematic bias in the solar radiation forecast. This is caused by the design of numerical weather prediction models, which typically account for the direct impact of aerosol particles on radiation using climatological mean values and the impact on cloud formation assuming spatially and temporally homogeneous aerosol concentrations. These model deficiencies in turn can lead to significant economic losses under extreme aerosol conditions. For Germany, Saharan dust outbreaks occurring 5 to 15 times per year for several days each are prominent examples for conditions, under which numerical weather prediction struggles to forecast solar radiation adequately. We investigate the impact of mineral dust on the PV power generation during a Saharan dust outbreak over Germany at 4 April 2014 using ICON-ART, which is the current German numerical weather prediction model extended by modules accounting for trace substances and related feedback processes. We find an overall improvement of the PV power forecast for 65{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the pyranometer stations in Germany. Of the nine stations with very high differences between forecast and measurement, eight stations show an improvement. Furthermore, we quantify the direct radiative effects and indirect radiative effects of mineral dust. For our study, direct effects account for 64{\&}thinsp;{\%}, indirect effects for 20{\&}thinsp;{\%} and synergistic interaction effects for 16{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the differences between the forecast including mineral dust radiative effects and the forecast neglecting mineral dust.},

abstract = {AbstractThe Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and vulnerable climate change “hotspots” of the twenty-first century, and the physical mechanisms underlying this finding are still not clear. Furthermore, complex interactions and feedbacks involving ocean–atmosphere–land–biogeochemical processes play a prominent role in modulating the climate and environment of the Mediterranean region on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is critical to provide robust climate change information for use in vulnerability–impact–adaptation assessment studies considering the Mediterranean as a fully coupled environmental system. The Mediterranean Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Med-CORDEX) initiative aims at coordinating the Mediterranean climate modeling community toward the development of fully coupled regional climate simulations, improving all relevant components of the system from atmosphere and ocean dynamics to land surface, hydrology, and biogeochemical processes. The primary goals of Med-CORDEX are to improve understanding of past climate variability and trends and to provide more accurate and reliable future projections, assessing in a quantitative and robust way the added value of using high-resolution and coupled regional climate models.

abstract = {Many clustering and segmentation algorithms both suffer from the limitation that the number of clusters/segments are specified by a human user. It is often impractical to expect a human with sufficient domain knowledge to be available to select the number of clusters/segments to return. In this paper, we investigate techniques to determine the number of clusters or segments to return from hierarchical clustering and segmentation algorithms. We propose an efficient algorithm, the L method, that finds the knee in a of clusters vs. clustering evaluation metric graph. Using the knee is well-known, but is not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine in which situations it will and will not work. We also compare the L method to existing methods based on the accuracy of the number of clusters that are determined and efficiency. Our results show favorable performance for these criteria compared to the existing methods that were evaluated.},

abstract = {Trends of all-sky downward surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite-derived data over Europe (1983–2010) are first presented. The results show a widespread (i.e., non-local dimension) increase in the major part of Europe, especially since the mid-1990s in the central and northern areas and in springtime. There is a mean increase of SSR of at least 2Wm−2 per decade from 1983 to 2010 over the whole Europe, which, taking into account that the satellite-derived product lacks of aerosol variations, can be mostly related to a decrease in the cloud radiative effects over Europe. Secondly, residual series have been derived as the result of the difference between ground-based and satellite-derived all-sky SSR data. The residual mean series points to a significant increase during the period 1983–2010, with higher rates of around 2Wm−2 per decade over central and eastern Europe. The spatial variation of these residual time series, which are in line with clear-sky SSR trends over Europe reported in the literature, seem to suggest that these differences in the residual series are not just explained by calibration issues in the satellite-derived product.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the spatial and temporal changes in sunshine duration (SunDu) and total cloud cover (TCC) over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and four subregions during 1961–2004 using high-quality, homogenized data sets. The analyses confirm that over most of the IP and in most seasons, SunDu and TCC variations are strongly negatively correlated, with absolute values ∼0.8–0.9. Somewhat weaker correlations (0.5–0.6) are found in the southern portion of the IP in summer. A large discrepancy between the SunDu and TCC records occurs from the 1960s until the early 1980s when the SunDu series shows a decrease that it is not associated with an increase in TCC. This negative trend or “dimming” is even more pronounced after removing the effects of TCC via linear regression. Since the early 1980s, the SunDu and TCC residual SunDu series exhibit an upward trend or “brightening.” In addition to the long-term dimming and brightening, the volcanic eruptions of El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo are clearly evident in the TCC residual SunDu record. The TCC and SunDu records over the IP are well correlated with sea level pressure (SLP), with above normal TCC and below normal SunDu corresponding to below normal SLP locally in all seasons. The TCC and SunDu related SLP changes over the IP in winter and spring are part of a larger-scale north-south dipole pattern that extends over the entire Euro-Atlantic sector. Other more regional atmospheric circulation patterns, identified from rotated principal component analysis, are also linked to TCC and SunDu variations over the IP. Finally and perhaps surprisingly, the TCC residual SunDu series exhibits a statistically significant relationship with a regional atmospheric circulation pattern during spring, summer, and autumn.},

abstract = {Electricity from wind and, to a lesser extent, solar energy is intermittent and not controllable. Unlike conventional power generation, therefore, this electricity is not suitable to supply base-load electric power. In the future, with greater penetration of these renewable sources, intermittency and control problems will become critical. Here, the authors explore the use of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for analyzing spatiotemporal balancing between regional solar and wind energy resources. The CCA allows optimal distribution of wind farms and solar energy plants across a territory to minimize the variability of total energy input into the power supply system. The method was tested in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula, a region covering about 350 000 km(2). The authors used daily-integrated wind and solar energy estimates in 2007 from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model, at a spatial resolution of 9 km. Results showed valuable balancing patterns in the study region, but with a marked seasonality in strength, sign, and spatial coverage. The autumn season showed the most noteworthy results, with a balancing pattern extending almost over the entire study region. With location of reference wind farms and photovoltaic (PV) plants according to the balancing patterns, their combined power production shows substantially lower variability than production of the wind farms and PV plants separately and combined production obtained with any other locations. Atmospheric circulations associated with the balancing patterns were found to be significantly different between seasons. In this regard, synoptic-scale variability played an important role, but so did topographic conditions, especially near the Strait of Gibraltar.},

abstract = {The operation of hydroelectric plants in Brazil depends on the hydrological regime, which is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations and faces critical levels of storage in certain periods. Hydropower accounts for 66{\%} of the countrys generation and poses a challenge for the stabilization of the grid in the mid and long terms. Usually, such fluctuations are complemented by conventional sources (thermo power). Studies have shown, however, that wind power can assist hydroelectric power generation. The water saved can be stored for energy generation and other purposes. This work addresses the possibility of complementing the hydro system with offshore wind power. To do so, monthly precipitation data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU-TS 3.1) [1] is compared with satellite winds from NOAA [2,3], to assess their variability on seasonal and interannual time scales. Results show high wind magnitudes in the North, Northeast, Southeast and Southern regions of Brazil. There is strong seasonal complementarity between the wind regimes of the Northeast and Northern regions. North and especially Northeast offshore winds were shown to be highly complementary with the hydrological regimes of S{\~{a}}o Francisco, Eastern Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, Paran{\'{a}}, Paraguai, Uruguai and South Atlantic basins. In addition, the southern hydrographic basin variability was found uncorrelated with other hydrological basins and wind regions.},

We show that the inter-annual trend in solar radiation between 1980 and 2000 mirrors the trend in primary emissions of SO2 and black carbon, which together contribute about one-third of global average aerosol optical depth. Combined global emissions of these two species peaked in 1988–1989. The two-decadal rate of decline in aerosol loading resulting from these emission changes, 0.13{\%} yr−1, can be compared with the reported increase in solar radiation of 0.10{\%} yr−1 in 1983–2001. Regional patterns of aerosol and radiation changes are also qualitatively consistent. We conclude that changes in the aerosol burden due to changing patterns of anthropogenic emissions are likely contributing to the trends in surface solar radiation.},

In contrast to other models, r.sun considers all relevant input parameters as spatially distributed entities to enable computations for large areas with complex terrain. Conceptually the model is based on equations published in the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA). The r.sun model was applied to estimate the solar potential for photovoltaic systems in Central and Eastern Europe. The overcast radiation was computed from clear-sky values and a clear-sky index. The raster map of the clear-sky index was computed using a multivariate interpolation method to account for terrain effects, with inter- polation parameters optimized using a cross-validation technique. The incorporation of terrain data improved the radiation estimates in terms of the model's predictive error and the spatial pattern of the model outputs. Comparing the results of r.sun with the ESRA database demonstrates that integration of the solar radiation model and the spatial interpolation tools in a GIS can be especially helpful for data at higher resolutions and in regions with a lack of ground measurements.},

abstract = {Abstract Global aerosol and ozone distributions and their associated radiative forcings were simulated between 1850 and 2100 following a recent historical emission dataset and under the representative concentration pathways (RCP) for the future. These simulations were used in an Earth System Model to account for the changes in both radiatively and chemically active compounds, when simulating the climate evolution. The past negative stratospheric ozone trends result in a negative climate forcing culminating at -0.15 W m-2 in the 1990s. In the meantime, the tropospheric ozone burden increase generates a positive climate forcing peaking at 0.41 W m-2. The future evolution of ozone strongly depends on the RCP scenario considered. In RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, the evolution of both stratospheric and tropospheric ozone generate relatively weak radiative forcing changes until 2060–2070 followed by a relative 30 {\%} decrease in radiative forcing by 2100. In contrast, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 model projections exhibit strongly different ozone radiative forcing trajectories. In the RCP2.6 scenario, both effects (stratospheric ozone, a negative forcing, and tropospheric ozone, a positive forcing) decline towards 1950s values while they both get stronger in the RCP8.5 scenario. Over the twentieth century, the evolution of the total aerosol burden is characterized by a strong increase after World War II until the middle of the 1980s followed by a stabilization during the last decade due to the strong decrease in sulfates in OECD countries since the 1970s. The cooling effects reach their maximal values in 1980, with -0.34 and -0.28 W m-2 respectively for direct and indirect total radiative forcings. According to the RCP scenarios, the aerosol content, after peaking around 2010, is projected to decline strongly and monotonically during the twenty-first century for the RCP8.5, 4.5 and 2.6 scenarios. While for RCP6.0 the decline occurs later, after peaking around 2050. As a consequence the relative importance of the total cooling effect of aerosols becomes weaker throughout the twenty-first century compared with the positive forcing of greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, both surface ozone and aerosol content show very different regional features depending on the future scenario considered. Hence, in 2050, surface ozone changes vary between -12 and ?12 ppbv over Asia depending on the RCP projection, whereas the regional direct aerosol radiative forcing can locally exceed -3 W m-2.},

abstract = {The electricity sector is currently considered mainly on the emission side of the climate change equation. In order to limit climate warming to below 2 °C, or even 1.5 °C, it must undergo a rapid transition towards carbon neutral production by the mid-century. Simultaneously, electricity generating technologies will be vulnerable to climate change. Here, we assess the impacts of climate change on wind, solar photovoltaic, hydro and thermoelectric power generation in Europe using a consistent modelling approach across the different technologies. We compare the impacts for different global warming scenarios: +1.5 °C, +2 °C and +3 °C. Results show that climate change has negative impacts on electricity production in most countries and for most technologies. Such impacts remain limited for a 1.5 °C warming, and roughly double for a 3 °C warming. Impacts are relatively limited for solar photovoltaic and wind power potential which may reduce up to 10{\%}, while hydropower and thermoelectric generation may decrease by up to 20{\%}. Generally, impacts are more severe in southern Europe than in northern Europe, inducing inequity between EU countries. We show that a higher share of renewables could reduce the vulnerability of power generation to climate change, although the variability of wind and solar PV production remains a significant challenge.},

abstract = {Climate change may alter the geographical pattern and intensity of near-surface winds which are the "fuel" for wind turbines. In a context of fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within ±15 and ±20 {\%} by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will not exceed 5 and 15 {\%} in magnitude at the European and national scale respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy mix plans.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

First, the problematic of using meteorological ground stations for the determining of solar dataset or time-series is addressed with the example of the French national meteorological network and the focus made on the South-West part of France: the heterogeneity in terms of spatial and temporal representativeness along with the relevance of the delivered measurement are questioned. Then, an innovative synthesis of 16 satellite-based ISS databases available so far is presented through the distribution of their corresponding features within three categories: spatial and temporal representativeness, data type in terms of component and format, and finally operating mode for the retrieving of the data in terms of price and accessibility. The results of this review shall help photovoltaic actors making the correlation between the available satellite-based databases and their specific needs.},

abstract = {A robust solar radiation dataset is essential for securing competitive financing for solar power projects. The majority of solar radiation datasets are derived from publically available data, though there are an increasing number of proprietary datasets being developed and marketed. Most of these new datasets represent models based on satellite images and validated with ground measured data. This paper focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of the existing publically available solar radiation databases, though the commentary is equally relevant to the newer commercial datasets. While the financing community generally views the solar resource as stable, it also views the material miscalculation of the solar resource as one of the biggest risks in a solar project. Therefore, lenders and rating agencies alike require verification of the solar resource dataset to be utilized at each project location as this translates directly into electric energy production forecasts and revenues. The variability of the solar resource as exhibited by the historical solar data and the accuracy of the dataset play significant roles in estimating the probability of future performance and influences the financial contract that the project is likely to receive. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Integrating variable and non-dispatchable renewable power generation into existing power systems will have consequences for their operation and future expansion. These impacts will depend on two factors: (1) the variability of the total renewable power generation on different time scales and (2) the possibilities of accurately forecasting these fluctuations. In this paper, previous research on variability assessment and forecasting of solar, wind, wave and tidal energy resources is reviewed. The aim is to summarize the state of knowledge in each area and to compare the approaches used for the respective resources. For temporal variability, methods and models used for assessing the variability are surveyed, as well as what is known about the variability at individual sites and for larger aggregates of sites. For forecasting, an overview of forecasting methods for the different resources is made, and selected forecasting methods are compared over different time horizons. An important finding is that it is hard to draw strong conclusions from the existing studies due to differences in approaches and presentation of results. There is a need for further, more coherent studies that analyze the variability for the different resources in comparable ways, using data with the same resolution, and for studies that evaluate the smoothing effect and complementarity of combinations of several renewable energy resources. For forecasting, future research should suggest ways to evaluate forecasts from different renewable energy sources in easily comparable ways, using data from the same locations or regions, with the same temporal and spatial resolution, and with comparable metrics for the forecasting errors.},

A decline in solar radiation at land surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from 1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the amount of solar radiation incident at the Earth's surface is not stable over the years but undergoes significant decadal variations. Here I review the evidence for these changes, their magnitude, their possible causes, their representation in climate models, and their potential implications for climate change. The various studies analyzing long-term records of surface radiation measurements suggest a widespread decrease in surface solar radiation between the 1950s and 1980s (''global dimming''), with a partial recovery more recently at many locations (''brightening''). There are also some indications for an ''early brightening'' in the first part of the 20th century. These variations are in line with independent long-term observations of sunshine duration, diurnal temperature range, pan evaporation, and, more recently, satellite-derived estimates, which add credibility to the existence of these changes and their larger-scale significance. Current climate models, in general, tend to simulate these decadal variations to a much lesser degree. The origins of these variations are internal to the Earth's atmosphere and not externally forced by the Sun. Variations are not only found under cloudy but also under cloud-free atmospheres, indicative of an anthropogenic contribution through changes in aerosol emissions governed by economic developments and air pollution regulations. The relative importance of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions may differ depending on region and pollution level. Highlighted are further potential implications of dimming and brightening for climate change, which may affect global warming, the components and intensity of the hydrological cycle, the carbon cycle, and the cryosphere among other climate elements.},

abstract = {Traditionally, for the planning and assessment of solar energy systems, the amount of solar radiation (sunlight) incident on the Earth's surface is assumed to be constant over the years. However, with changing climate and air pollution levels, solar resources may no longer be stable over time and undergo substantial decadal changes. Observational records covering the past decades confirm long-term changes in this quantity. Here we examine how the latest generation of climate models used for the 5th IPCC report projects potential changes in surface solar radiation over the coming decades, and how this may affect, in combination with the expected greenhouse warming, solar power output from photovoltaic (PV) systems. For this purpose, projections up to the mid 21st century from 39 state of the art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analysed globally and for selected key regions with major solar power production capacity. The large model ensemble allows to assess the degree of consistency of their projections. Models are largely consistent in the sign of the projected changes in solar radiation under cloud-free conditions as well as surface temperatures over most of the globe, while still reasonably consistent over a considerable part of the globe in the sign of changes in cloudiness and associated changes in solar radiation. A first order estimate of the impact of solar radiation and temperature changes on energy yields of PV systems under the RPC8.5 scenario indicates statistically significant decreases in PV outputs in large parts of the world, but notable exceptions with positive trends in large parts of Europe, South-East of North America and the South-East of China. Projected changes between 2006 and 2049 under the RCP8.5 scenario overall are on the order of 1{\%}/decade for horizontal planes, but may be larger for tilted or tracked planes as well as on shorter (decadal) timescales.},

abstract = {A consistent poleward and upward shift and intensification of the storm tracks is found in an ensemble of 21st century climate simulations performed by 15 coupled climate models. The shift of the storm tracks is accompanied by a poleward shift and upward expansion of the midlatitude baroclinic regions associated with enhanced warming in the tropical upper troposphere and increased tropopause height. The poleward shift in baroclinicity is augmented in the Southern Hemisphere and partially offset in the Northern Hemisphere by changes in the surface meridional temperature gradient. The poleward shift of the storm tracks also tends to be accompanied by poleward shifts in surface wind stress and precipitation, and a shift towards the high index state of the annular modes. These results highlight the integral role that the storm tracks play in the climate system, and the importance of understanding how and why they will change in the future.},

abstract = {This work presents a cluster analysis for the determination of coherent zones of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) for a utility scale territory in California, which is serviced by San Diego Gas {\&} Electric. Knowledge of these coherent zones, or clusters, would allow utilities and power plants to realize cost savings through regional planning and operation activities such as the mitigation of solar power variability through the intelligent placement of solar farms and the optimal placement of radiometric stations. In order to determine such clusters, two years of gridded satellite data were used to describe the evolution of GHI over a portion of Southern California. Step changes of the average daily clear-sky index at each location are used to characterize the fluctuation of GHI. The k-means clustering algorithm is applied in conjunction with a stable initialization method to diminish its dependency to random initial conditions. Two validity indices are then used to define the quality of the cluster partitions as well as the appropriate number of clusters. The clustering algorithm determined an optimal number of 14 coherent spatial clusters of similar GHI variability as the most appropriate segmentation of the service territory map. In addition, 14 cluster centers are selected whose radiometric observations may serve as a proxy for the rest of the cluster. A correlation analysis, within and between the proposed clusters, based both on single-point ground-based and satellite-derived measurements evaluates positively the coherence of the conducted clustering. This method could easily be applied to any other utility scale region and is not dependent on GHI data which shows promise for the application of such clustering methods to load data and/or other renewable resources such as wind. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Methods applied on efficient planning of ground-based monitoring networks of surface solar irradiance could provide valuable scientific results and be useful for accurate monitoring and efficient planning of solar energy applications. Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness of the proposed sites is also assessed. The proposed number of stations could be considered as the basis to build the climatology of surface solar irradiance over Greece. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose a novel methodology to select candidate locations for solar power plants that take into account solar variability and geographical smoothing effects. This methodology includes the development of maps created by a clustering technique that determines regions of coherent solar quality attributes as defined by a feature which considers both solar clearness and solar variability. An efficient combination of two well-known clustering algorithms, the affinity propagation and the k-means, is introduced in order to produce stable partitions of the data to a variety of number of clusters in a computationally fast and reliable manner. We use 15. years worth of the 30-min GHI gridded data for the island of Lanai in Hawaii to produce, validate and reproduce clustering maps. A family of appropriate number of clusters is obtained by evaluating the performance of three internal validity indices. We apply a correlation analysis to the family of solutions to determine the map segmentation that maximizes a definite interpretation of the distinction between and within the emerged clusters. Having selected a single clustering we validated the clustering by using a new dataset to demonstrate that the degree of similarity between the two partitions remains high at 90.91{\%}. In the end we show how the clustering map can be used in solar energy problems. Firstly, we explore the effects of geographical smoothing in terms of the clustering maps, by determining the average ramp ratio for two location within and without the same cluster and identify the pair of clusters that shows the highest smoothing potential. Secondly, we demonstrate how the map can be used to select locations for GHI measurements to improve solar forecasting for a PV plant, by showing that additional measurements from within the cluster where the PV plant is located can lead to improvements of 10{\%} in the forecast.},

abstract = {This pair of articles presents the results of a study about forecasting photovoltaic (PV) electricity production for some power plants in mainland France. Forecasts are built with statistical methods exploiting outputs from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Contrary to most other studies, forecasts are built without using technical information on the power plants. In each article, several statistical methods are used to build forecast models and their performance is compared by means of adequate scores. When a best forecast emerges, its characteristics are then further assessed in order to get a deeper insight of its merits and flaws. The robustness of the results are evaluated with an intense use of cross-validation.This article deals with probabilistic forecasts of daily production 2. days ahead. By "probabilistic" we mean that our forecast models yield some quantiles of the expected production's probability distribution. Whereas probabilistic forecasts are quite usual in wind power forecasting, they are more unusual in the field of PV production forecasting. We show that our eight forecasts always perform better than a simple climatological reference forecast. Nevertheless, no forecast model clearly dominates the other, whatever the studied power plant. A post-processing technique aiming at improving forecasts may in fact decrease their performance. Finally, we use outputs from an ensemble NWP model in order to add information about the meteorological forecast uncertainty. Sometimes this ensemble improves the performance of forecasts, but this is not always true. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{ZSCHEISCHLER2012897,
abstract = {Classifying the land surface according to different climate zones is often a prerequisite for global diagnostic or predictive modelling studies. Classical classiﬁcations such as the prominent K̈oppen–Geiger (KG) approach rely on heuristic decision rules. Although these heuristics may transport some process understanding, such a discretization may appear “arbitrary” from a data oriented perspective. In this contribution we compare the precision of a KG classiﬁcation to an unsupervised classiﬁcation (k-means clustering). Generally speaking, we revisit the problem of “climate classiﬁcation” by investigating the inherent patterns in multiple data streams in a purely data driven way. One question is whether we can reproduce the KG boundaries by exploring different combinations of climate and remotely sensed vegetation variables. In this context we also investigate whether climate and vegetation variables build similar clusters. In terms of statistical performances, k-means clearly outperforms classical climate classiﬁcations. However, a subsequent stability analysis only reveals a meaningful number of clusters if both climate and vegetation data are considered in the analysis. This is a setback for the hope to explain vegetation by means of climate alone. Clearly, classiﬁcation schemes like K̈oppen-Geiger will play an important role in the future. However, future developments in this area need to be assessed based on data driven approaches.},
