\chapter{Data\label{cha:Data}}

  In the present chapter, the databases used in the manuscript are described. Different types of data are used in each of the studies due to the fact that different problems are addressed. A more specific description is included in later chapters.

  There are many applications from meteorology to agriculture or even health sciences, that would benefit from an accuarate station network that provide high quality radiation measurements at the surface. However, it is well-known that the lack of  well spread solar radiation measurements has been a constrain not only for the development of solar forecasting or resource assessment techniques, but also for the study of the whole atmospheric/climatic processes in which solar radiation takes places. The progress and improvement in the satellite-based products has helped to overcome some of these issues providing gridded data at a high spatial and temporal resolution.

  Part of this work has been developed through what could be called a modeling chain approach, which is explained in next chapters. This modeling chain is formed by a model that provides solar radiation data and a model that computes PV production from these input. Due to that, the data input of the PV model is also included in this section, which is solar radiation from climate models.

As this work is focused on long time scales and in wide areas, time and horizontal resolution of girdded data used are not considered a constrain to our analysis in most cases. Due to that, as it would be explained below, finner temporal resolution used in this work is daily and the horizontal resolution of the gridded datasets goes from 0.05º for a satellite-based product and 0.44º for data from regional climate models.

\section{Solar Radiation data}

\subsection{Solar radiation measurements}% \textit{Baseline Surface Radiation Network, BSRN}}

The measurement of solar radiation is based on radiometers that measure the solar energy reaching the earth's surface. These radiometers are able to measure electromagnetic solar radiation at different wavelengths. For energy purposes, the interest of solar radiation measurements is on the shortwave range of the spectrum.

Solar radiation can be decomposed in three components: direct normal irradiation, diffuse irradiation and the albedo, as it is explain in section []. These three components added form the global solar irradiation G(0) that reach the surface. Different instrumentation can be used to measure each of the components.

% Solar radiation data from ground stations are not common at the publicly available metheorological stations. Solar global radiation is measured with instruments called pyranometers 

%Iqbal 1983
% The science behind the measurement of electromagnetic radiation is called ra-
% diometry. Historically, simple instrumentation has been long used to evaluate the
% duration of bright sunshine in relation to day length. Radiometers of various de-
% signs have then been perfected to measure the energy in specific “components” of
% terrestrial solar radiation, as will be defined in Sect. 3. The interested reader should
% consult other textbooks (e.g., Coulson 1975; Iqbal 1983) for historical and technical
% details about common instruments used in solar radiometry.
% Radiometers are constituted of different parts, mainly a casing or body, a radiation
% detector, and some electronics, including electrical circuits. For the instruments un-
% der scrutiny here, whose main purpose is to measure shortwave radiation (as op-
% posed to UV or thermal radiation), detectors can be of three main types: thermopile,
% blackbody cavity, and solid state (semiconductor). The detector has a known spec-
% tral response to incident radiation. It is generally protected from the environment
% with some type of optical window, which can be transparent (e.g., glass or quartz),
% colored (e.g., interference filter), or translucent (e.g., white diffuser). The win-
% dow optical transmission further limits the spectral range of the radiation actually
% measured


Historically, first intruments that measures solar radiation were based on intruments to calculate the duration of bright sunshine, following the needs of agriculture to understand evaporation \cite*{sengupta2017best}. For that time, the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder was the most used \cite*{sengupta2017best}, although it was not a radiometer. It worked focusing the direct beam of solar irradiation to create burn marks in a record paper when the DNI exceded certain value. Through the comparison of the burned length to the day length it was possible to characterize solar radiation at each place \cite*{Iqbal2012Introduction}.

By the early 20th century, it was developed the pyranometers to measure global solar irradiation. Pyranometers are also able to measure the diffurse component through a shading device that exclude direct radiation from the sun. For direct solar irradiation, the instruments are called pyrheliometers and they measure direct solar beam at normal incidence.
 
Actual radiometers are of three different types: thermopile, blackbody cavity, and solid state \cite*{Gueymard2008}. The detector of the instrumentation has a known spectral response to incident radiation and it is protected with an optical window that can be used to limit the spectral range of the radiation measured, which is important for energy purposes \cite*{Gueymard2008}. 

% Instruments designed to measure any for  m of radiation are called radiometers. The earliest developments of instrumentation for measuring solar radiation were designed to meet the needs of agriculture for bright sunshine duration to understnd evaporation and by physicists for determining the solar constant. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the most widely deployed instrument for measuring solar radiation was the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder (Iqbal 1983; Vignola, Michalsky, and Stoffel 2012). This analog device focuses the direct beam by a simple spherical lens (glass ball) to create burn marks during clear periods (when DNI exceeds 120 Wm-2) on a sensitized paper strip placed daily in the focus curve. By comparing the total burn length to the corresponding day length, records of percent possible sunshine from stations around the world became the basis for characterizing the global distribution of solar radiation (Löf et al. 1966). The earliest pyrheliometers (from the Greek for fire, sun, and measure) were based on calorimetry and used by scientists to measure brief periods of DNI from various locations, generally at high elevations to minimize the effects of a thick atmosphere on the transmission of solar radiation. By the early 20th century, scientists had developed pyranometers (from the Greek for fire, above, and measure) to measure GHI for understanding the Earth’s energy budget (Vignola, Michalsky, and Stoffel 2012).

Different research programs are in charge of assure quality of some important solar radiation measurements databases. These significant research works are the Baseline surface radiation network, BSRN \cite*{Konig-Langlo2013}, the International Daylight Measurement Program \cite*{dumortier1999status}, the Global Energy Balance Archive, GEBA \cite*{Gilgen1998} or the World Radiation Data Center, WRDC (http://wrdc.mgo.rssi.ru/). All of them are only applicable for research purposes and no-comercial activities. To these databases can be added different country-level databases that have a dense network but the availability of global solar irradiation measurements and, to a further extent, different components is not always assured.

% Solar radiation has been measured by national networks for several decades. Part of the collected data has been
% processed, in the scope of research programs, in order to setup – alas – few reliable networks with heterogeneous
% spatial coverage [8]: from about 50 ground stations for Baseline surface radiation network (BSRN [9]) and
% International daylight measurement program (IDMP, http://idmp.entpe.fr/) up to more than 1,000 for Global energy
% balance archive (GEBA [10]) and World radiation data center (WRDC, http://wrdc.mgo.rssi.ru/). As part of scientific
% research programs, the added-value for such databases mainly consists in the high-quality of the available data,
% considering that stringent requirements have been defined:
% x The quality of the sensors;
% x The periodic on-site maintenance along with sensor calibration;
% x The quality-check procedure to ensure the reliability of the measurement [11].
% Despite such a quality check, data aggregation (yearly, monthly, daily and even hourly) always needs to be viewed
% with a critical eye because of the missing data and the shading problematic that may differ from one ground station to
% another.
% Major obst

\subsubsection{BSRN}

One of the main sources of high quality data, as it has been previously commented, is the \textit{Baseline Surface Radiation Network}, BSRN \cite*{Konig-Langlo2013}. %[König-Langlo, G. , Sieger, R. , Schmithüsen, H. , Bücker, A. , Richter, F. and Dutton E.G. 2013. The Baseline Surface Radiation Network and its World Radiation Monitoring Centre at the Alfred Wegener Institute.
%GCOS - 174, WCRP Report 24/2013, 30 pp..] \\

The aim of the BSRN project is to detect changes in the Earth's radiation field that could be a consequence of climatic changes. The monitoring network provides high-quality and high-frequence data of short and long-wave radiation fluxes from different stations around the globe, which correspond to different climatic zones. In figure \ref{fig:bsrnstations} all the available stations from BSRN are displayed.

The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Radiative Fluxes Working Group initiated the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) to support the research projects of the WCRP and other scientific programs related to solar radiation. By the time this manuscript is written, 52 BSRN are in operation. There are some stations with ``candidate'' status and some that will be close in 2019. Among these stations there are different levels of data provided, from the basic measurements that include the components of solar radiation, air temperature and pressure to other variables and synoptic observations.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Satellite data}
 
%It has been previously commented that the scarcity of available ground-based solar radiation measurements is a well-known problem.
Satellite datasets have become one of the main used sources of solar iradition data for energy resource assessment and forecasting. Solar irradiation derived from satellites is itself a product of modelization and their main pro is their high spatial and temporal resolution as well as their increasing accuracy. 

There are different methods to retrieve solar radiation from satellite images that goes from physical models to empirical ones. In the first case, the models try to explain the radiance observed by the satellite instrumentation with a radiation transfer model (RTM). In order to do that, it is necessary to know the composition of the atmosphere. On the other hand, empirical models are based on simple regression models between the visible-channel's recorded intensity and grounded measurements. 

It is possible to extract cloudiness information from the satellite radiance information due to the fact that intensity of the measurements change depending on the composition of the atmosphere and the cloud cover. Considering that, a simple equation can describe the relationship between the radiance measured and the amount of clouds, this was called \textbf{cloud index [Cano].}

To retrieve solar radiation form satellites, most empirical methods considers a linear relationship between the cloud index and atmospheric transmittance \cite*{Polo2008} [Polo libro, (Cano et al. 1986; Diabaté et al. 1988; Schmetz. 1989; Diabaté et al. 1989; Noia et al. 1993a; Ineichen and Perez. 1999; Zelenka et al. 1999; Perez 2002; Rigollier et al. 2004; Zarzalejo et al. 2005)].  

%* cloud index?
%* clear sky index ?

There are also some approaches that are in between theses two sides: the semi-empirical models, which have become the most common approach \cite*{Polo2008}. They use a simple radiative-transfer scheme and some statistical regressions between data from satellite sensors and observed data (Schmetz (1989), Noia et al. (1993), Pinker et al. (1995), Zelenka (2001), and Hammer et al (2003)).\footnote{Jan Kleiss, Solar Energy Forecasting and Resource assessment, pp.22.23}

% The importance of the cloud index concept bases on the fact that satellite
% information (basically cloud cover information) can be related with the solar irradi-
% ance incoming to the earth surface. Consequently, most empirical/statistical method-
% ologies to retrieve solar irradiance from satellite images rely on the assumption
% of linear relationship between the atmospheric transmittance and the cloud index
% (Cano et al. 1986; Diabaté et al. 1988; Schmetz. 1989; Diabaté et al. 1989; Noia
% et al. 1993a; Ineichen and Perez. 1999; Zelenka et al. 1999; Perez 2002; Rigollier
% et al. 2004; Zarzalejo et al. 2005).

There are two types of satellites orbiting the earth: The polar orbiting, closer to the earth surface,  with high spatial resolution but limitations in the temporal coverage, and the geostationary satellites (~36000km from the earth's surface) with high spatial and temporal resolution. This last kind of satellites are the commonly used to derived solar radiation at the surface.

The uncertainty in the satellite radiation estimation comes from different sources. First, Sun elevation affects the determination of clouds position due to the increase of reflections, increasing  the uncertainty for low Sun elevation. Other factors are related to geographical factors. The high albedo of some surfaces like desserts or ice areas makes difficult the determination of clouds, increasing uncertainty (Cebecauer et al. 2011).

There are many solar irradiation datasets derived from satellite products available nowadays: Meteonorm, SolarGIS, CM-SAF, Helio-Clim etc. Their differences are based on different parameters that goes from the data source, one or several satellites, the spatial coverage and resolution, the time resolution or its accesibility related to its private/comercial purposes. An in detailed review of 16 of the most common satellite derived datasets is made in \cite*{Vernay2014}.

\subsubsection{Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility: CM-SAF}

In this work some satellite-data-based products from CM-SAF (The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring) have been used. The aim of CM-SAF consortium from EUMETSAT [ref] is to develop satellite-data-based-products for climate monitoring since 2000 when it was recognised the importance of using satellite for this purpose.

The CM SAF products are derived from several instruments on-board operational satellites in geostationary and polar orbits. There are two main types of products that can be obtained from the CM-SAF: operational products and climate data records (CDR). The main purpose of the CDR is to provide a high-quality database to monitor climate variability and changes \cite*{Muller2015}, as well as the detection of trends. Operational products, on the other hand, are not accurate enough for this purpose because some errors like inter-satellite biases or sensors degradation are not corrected.


The SARAH dataset from CM-SAF has been used in chapters 6 and 7 of this manuscript for the analysis of shortwave solar radiation at the surface. The data is based on the records from Meteosat images, first and second generation, using the on-board MVIRI and SEVIRI instruments respectively \cite*{posselts2012}. As the purpose of the CDR is to provide long time series convering more than 20 years, it is necessary a retrieval algorithm that can be applied to SEVIRI intruments as well as to the older MVIRI. This algorithm has been called MAGICSOL and has two parts: first, the modified \textbf{Heliosat} method is used to obtain the cloud effective albedo (CAL), also called \textit{cloud index};  and second, the \textbf{MAGIC} appoach is used to obtain all sky surface radiation based on CAL \cite*{posselts2012}. (ref PUM)

The \textbf{clear sky index} can be defined as the ration betwen all-sky irradiation and the clear sky irradiation. For most of the conditions it can be generalized a relationship between the clear sky index and the effective cloud albedo, CAL:

\begin{equation}
  k=1-CAL
\end{equation}

Clear sky radiation is obtained through the MAGIC algorithm (Muller2009) that consist on simulations of a radiative transfer model (RTM) and an interpolation method using discrete values of the RTM runs, which reduce the computational time (Muller2009). Inputs of atomspheric state are needed: aerosols, water vapour etc.. After that, with the knowdlege of the clear sky index and the the clear sky surface radiation, it can be derived the all-sky radiation at the surface. An scheme representing the proccess to obtain direct and global solar irradiation is presented in figure \ref{fig:algorithm}\\

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/esquema}
  \caption{Algorithm scheme: Retrieval of shortwave solar radiation from satellite images.}
 \label{fig:algorithm}
\end{figure}

Information about \textbf{aerosols} to be used in the MAGIC algorithm is obtained from the ECMWF-MACC reanalyses. The MACC (ref) data is a combination of a model for aerosol composition and dynamic (Morcrette 2009) and a data assimilation system (Benedetti et añ 2009). Monthly mean aerosol information is included in the algorithm to obtain clear sky irradiation. The MACC data has to be regridded to a higher resolution 0.5x0.5 to the use within CM-SAF.

\subsection{Solar radiation from climate models}%Modeling of solar radiation}

%In order to understand the processes that take places when solar radiation goes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth's surface it is necessary a modeling approach. This modeling process can be made by a physical approach or using statistical methods.

Solar irradiation at the earth's surface can be measured using the above mentioned instrumentation or can be obtained trough modelization, with physical or statistical methods, as it was explained in chapter 2.

{\color{red} Climate models are a representation of the whole climatic system. Inside, they have a radiative transfer squeme that gives solar radiation at the surface by solving the radiative tranfer equation. Due to the complexity of climate system, and the low spatial resolution of climate models, some processes has to be simplified and others need to be parametrized. Due to that different RTM can be implemented in different climate models.}

{\color{red} Añadir algo más acerca de como se obtiene la radiación en climate models?}
%The physical modeling of solar radiation is based on physical equations of the interaction between atmospheric components and solar radiation (aerosols, water vapour, clouds...). When solar radiation goes through the atmosphere, it can interact with its components being absorbed by molecules, backscattered to space or scattered in any other direction. Thus, only part of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) will reach the Earth's surface.

%This process is the physical process of energy transfer described by the radiative transfer equation (RTE) and its solution needs a radiative transfer model (RTM). The radiative transfer is a very complex process that needs to be simplified to be solved numerically and some parametrizations are needed. However, from these models it is possible to reproduce the solar radiation behaviour across the atmosphere and at the surface. RTMs are in the core of numerical weather prediction models, NWP, and climate models and sometimes they are used to obtain solar radiation from satellite images, although in this case empirical or semi-empirical approaches are also commonly applied.

%Secondly, the solar radiation at the surface can be estimated using statistical methods. In this case it is necessary to have enough data to validate the model and likely these models will not be able to reproduce solar behaviour universally. However, they can be very useful for local applications.

In chapters 6 and 7 different climate models are used as main source of solar radiation data. The output of each model will be the result of the radiative scheme inside their codes and it can be used as the input variable for a photovoltaic production model to analyse photovoltaic potential under different climate conditions.

\subsubsection{CORDEX initiative}

Under the acronim of CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Downscalling Experiment) have been developed a wide range of regional climate models\footnote{The chapter \ref{cha:Methods} explain the origin of regional climate modelling and the simulations used in the thesis} that provide climate downscalled simulations for different areas around the globe\footnote{Cordex website:http://www.cordex.org/. This international framework is under the umbrella of the world climate research program, WRCP} . Their importance arise with the advance in knowdlege of climate change provided by global models. Whereas those models give an overview of the evolution of global conditions, their coarse resolution is not enough to understand climate change impacts at a local scale. The higher resolution of the regional climate models are needed for supporting adaptation and mitigation plans.

Two different domains from CORDEX are used in this study both focus on the Mediterranean area: EURO-CORDEX and MED-CORDEX (in figure \ref{fig:cordexdomain}). The horizontal resolution of the simulations included in EURO/MED-CORDEX goes from 0.44º to 0.11º (from ~50km to ~12km).

\begin{figure}[!tbp]

  \caption{Domains from Med-CORDEX and Euro-CORDEX. Images from wRCP-CORDEX website.}
    \label{fig:cordexdomain}
\end{figure}

Main differences between the two initiatives, in addition to the study domain represented in figure \ref{fig:cordexdomain}, is that simulations from MED-CORDEX are runs from couple ocean-atmosphere climate models, whereas the EURO-CORDEX ensemble inludes only atmosphere models.

\section{Photovoltaic prodution data}

In order to evaulate the performance of a PV model it is necessary to use the data from real PV plants. However, these data is not easy to obtain, due to the fact that it belongs to private companies and it could compromise some of their strategies. This makes necessary to get agreements and confidential contracts between these companies and researchers that are not always easy to obtain if an inmediate benefit does not arise from those relationships.

Some alternatives are the databases of aggregated data that are available for the European countries throught the ETNSO-e data portal website. However, these data will be only useful for certain modeling exercices but have limitations due to the fact that there is a lack of information related to the power plant locations in each country.

In this work two power plants data have been used in order to compare simulations with the real data. The limitations of these two plants is that they are both located in the Iberian Peninsula, and the length of the time series is limited. However, due to the difficulties to obtain these kind of data, it is useuful to compare the modelling chain approach used in chapter 6 with the real data.

% \item {\color{red} ¿Tiene sentido que comente aquí los datos de ETNSO?}
% \item {\color{red}No tengo claro si describir aquí las dos plantas que tenemos y que se utilizan en el segundo artículo}
% \end{itemize}

\section{Temperature data}

  In adittion to the direct relationship between solar irradiation and photovoltaic energy conversion, there are other atmospheric variables that influence the performance of solar cells, like temperatura or wind speed. The model used in this work consider only temperature as a second order factor that reduces cell efficiency as it is explained in chapter 4.
 
  Temperature data is easier to obtain than solar radiation data. Numerous weather stations provides temperature data at 2m over the surface at a local scale. For an overview of a large area gridded products are useful and easier to combine with the satellite products.

\subsection{E-OBS dataset}
  
  E-OBS is a gridded dataset derived through interpolation from the ECA\&D data based on stations that provides daily temperatura data over Europe and the Mediterranean area \footnote{https://www.ecad.eu//download/ensembles/download.php#maps}. This product has been validated in several research papers (Begert et al. 2008, Hofstra et al. 2009a,b) finding that some inaccuaracies related to an over-smooth exists in areas where there are few stations, which affects mostly to the extreme analyses.

The horizontal resolution of the gridded products is 0.25º or 0.44º whereas the time resolution is daily, with time series going from January 1950 until June 2018.

\end{figure}

\section{Aerosols datasets}

Atmospheric aerosols content can be summarized by the AOD, aerosol optical depth, paramenter; which is the integration among an atmospheric column of the incident light that is scattered or absorbed by aerosols. Since the 1980s, different sensors from satellites has been used to derived AOD and at the same time, some models has been developed and provide AOD climatologies as well as the contribution of different species to the total AOD [nabat 2013].

From the measurements side, the \textbf{AERONET} network \cite*{Holben1998} was initiated by NASA in the 90s and it has grown to become a widely spread network of radiometers accross different continents based on international cooperation. This ground-based aerosols monitoring network allows to characterize from local to global profiles directly related with earth's radiation budget studies. It has become also an important database for evaluation of satellite derived and model AOD products.

There are different datasets for the Mediterranean area, very influenced by natural and antrophogenic aerosols derived from satellite observations, like MODIS, MISR, or SEVIRI; or from model simulations like Reg-CM4 or MACC reanalysis. The first intercomparison of aerosols datasets can be found in [nabat2013] where an improved 4-D climatoloy of aerosols is developed for the area.

\subsection{Aerosols in RCMs}

The representation of aerosols in RCMs depends on the model. The AOD is used for calculating aerosols radiating forcing in RCMs simulations. In spite of the fact that some studies have shown the influence of anthropogenic aerosols in Europe climate variability [ref] and its influence in the brightening period over Europe (1980-2012), the representation of aerosols in RCMs is still scarce. Some include a fixed climatology of AOD like Tegen or the old one of Tanré, whereas other do not include any aerosols for their simulations. The most complex include an interactive squeme, that is necessary for daily scales and also for future projections.

Up to now, only in [nabat2014], simulations with ALADIN-RCSM4 are able to reproduce SSR trends over Europe in past decades after applying an interannual aerosols dataset described in [nabat 2013]. A more recent study includes ammoniun and nitrates species for long simulations (197-2016) over the Euro-Mediterranean area with the same RCMs (ALADIN-RCSM) with an interactive aerosol scheme. [drughe, tactic]

In future climate projections over the Euro-Mediterranean area with RCMs (under the MED-CORDEX or EURO-CORDEX frame), few models include aerosols time evolution. Most of them include a fixed climatoloy for present climate conditions that is also applied invariantly for future projections. The models that include time evolving aerosols in their runs apply different inventories: Szopa 2013, Lamarqué 2010 etc.

Information about aerosols datasets and description (prescribed, interactive schemes etc.) is not an information easy to access from the website where climate projections users can download different simulations. Instead, a task of complile information from modellers is needed, which difficults the process. In next table a summary of the known aerosols information of climate simulations from EURO-CORDEX is included.

\chapter{Methods\label{cha:methods}}

In order to fullfill the objectives of the present work it is necessary to apply different methodologies in each of the results chapters, all of them has been explained in detail at the corresponding section. %In general, they goes through the statistic analysis of different variables related to solar resource and photovoltaic production, where the latter comes from an estimation using a PV model. %The analysis is also developed in different time scales, which leads to the necessity of adapt the same methodology to each case.\\

However, in the present chapter the different tools needed for the development of each study are described in a general manner. The three results chapters are based in a \textbf{modeling chain} that includes a photovoltaic model that is composed of two basic steps. First, the transposition to the plane-of-the-array, POA, of the components of the solar radiation, which implies also to assume some simple models of the atmosphere sphere seen from the generator plane and a model for the electrical performance of the system. Besides, the input of this PV model can be solar radiation measurments, satellite radition estimations or, as we saw in the previous chapter, the output of atmospheric/climate models. 

%En general, el método consite en la creación de una cadena de modelado que incluye un modelo de producción fotovoltaica, compuesto por el paso al plano del generador fotovoltaico de las componentes de la radiación solar y un modelo de funcionamiento eléctrico del sistema. Además, se el input de este modelo fotovoltaico podrán ser observaciones de radiación solar medidas en superficie, estimaciones de satélite o, como vimos en el capítulo anterior, radiación solar obtenida a partir de la salida de modelos.
%  En el primer capítulo, se analizará de manera espacial la variabilidad interanual y la complementariedad del recurso solar en la Península Ibérica, para lo que se aplicarán técnicas de \textbf{clustering}. La evaluación de la productividad fotovoltaica lleva asociada la necesidad de la \textbf{modelización de un sistema fotovoltaico}.\\

  In chapter 5 it is analysed the interannual variability and complementarity of solar resource over the Iberian Peninsula and for that purpose we apply \textbf{clustering techniques}. The regionalization allow us to simplify the spatio-temporal analysis of solar resource. The evaluation of the productivity, defined as the amount of energy produced by a PV system normalized by the power capacity of the system, means the \textbf{modelization of the photovoltaic system}.
  
  The chapter 6 analyses the impact of \textbf{aerosols} in photovoltaic productivity over the Euro-Mediterranean area for present climate and past conditions.  Some climate simulations forced by the ERA-INTERIM reanalysis are used as the input of the photovoltaic model. The modelling chain allows to make a sensitivity test to quantify the role of aerosols in the area.

%  En el segundo capítulo se estudia el impacto de los aerosoles en la producitvidad fotovoltaica, esta vez en el área Euro-Mediterránea. En este caso, las \textbf{simulaciones climáticas} serán utilizadas como input del modelo fotovoltaico, creando una cadena de modelado que permita realizar un ejercicio comparativo de sensibilidad para cuantificar el papel de los aerosoles.\\
  
  Finally, the photovoltaic energy potential is analysed in the future, using \textbf{climate projections} from different climate models. Trends and anomalies with respect to a reference period are evaluated. In this case, a \textbf{multi-model analysis} through different RCMs simulations allow us to evaluate the solar resource under climate change scenarios. The representation of aerosols in the climate projections is consider as a fundamental variable for the shortwave downward radiation projections, SSR, and PV productivity.

\section{Clustering algorithm applied to climate data}
% The culstering algorithms are design for grouping together variables and recognise patterns between them that are difficult to see at first sigth. This algorithm were first applied in ... and they have grown quickly adapting to a highly data-driven world.

% Pattern recognition: extraer objetos y agruparlos en clases. Dependiendo de las distintas disciplinas, estos objetos pueden ser muy diferentes. Se utiliza el pattern recognition en el reconocimeiento de imágenes, de palábras, ayuda en el diagnóstico, o para el análisis de bases de datos en data mining. En este último, las aplicaciones van desde la biología a las finanzas o ciencias sociales y en un data-driven world, cada vez adquiere una importancia mayor, transformando los datos en conocimiento.

% En primer lugar, se definen las características que se van a emplear como medida de similitud/similaridad utilizada para la clasificación. Una vez que estas características están definidas, los algoritmos de clustering se encargan de agrupar  estas características.

%En un mundo cada vez más movido por los datos, el reconocimiento de patrones se ha utilizado en  muchas disciplinas, desde la biología a las finanzas o las ciencias socialses, para extraer información relevante de los diferentes conjuntos de datos. Éstas técnicas, ayudan a conocer relaciones difíciles de extraer a simple vista, bien por el volumen de los datos, o por la complejidad de las mismas y la cantidad de variables involucradas. 

In a data-driven world, \textbf{pattern recognition} is being applied to many disciplines from biology to finanze through social science, in order to obtain relevant information from different datasets.
However, if the similarity measurements of the data cannot be define first, due to unknown previous labeled data, another approach will be implemented: the task will consist in identifying the similarities afterwards, from a dataset of features, applying clustering algorithms for that purpose.

\subsection{Clustering algorithms}

It is not under the scope of this work to analayse in detail all the clustering methods available, due to the vast number of them and its increasing complexity [ref:data clustering a review]. However, it is worth it to give an overview of its classification and application in order to better understand the choice made in the study of our problem.

There are different types of clustering algorithms based on its application and the criteria applied to construct the clusters. The two main categories are divided in \textbf{hierarchical} and \textbf{non-hierarchical algorithms}, but there are other taxonomies based on the algorithm construction that can be used to classified different methods [ref].

The \textbf{hierarchical clustering algorithms} create a number of nested clusters and they can be also divided themselves in agglomerative or divisive. The first one, obtain a smaller number of cluster in each step, whereas the divisive algorithms work on the other direction.

Most of these hierarchical algorithms are variants of the single-link or complete-link algorithms. They have a different way to measure similarity. In the first case, the distance between two clusters is the minimum of all the pairwise distances measured between the objects of the two clusters, in contrast, for the complete-link algorithm the distance is considered the maximum of all the pairwise distances.

On the orther hand, the non-hierarchical or \textbf{partitional clustering algoritm}, create a number of non-overlapping clusters. These methods could be useful when the amount of data involved is large and the construction of a dendogram, produced by the hierarchical algorithm could be computational expensive.

The partitional methods create the group of clusters using an \textbf{optimization function} which defines the similarity. The main inconvenient of these algorithms is the in-advanced definition of the number of clusters. Usually, the algorithm is implemented several times for a wide number of partitions and the optimum number of clusters is defined afterwards using validity index criteria.

\subsection{Clustering climate data}

As previously commented, the use of pattern recognition and in particular, the clustering analysis, has been widely used across many different disciplines. The use of these techniques to group together atmospheric variables that could help in environmental classifications is a more recent research field.[ref]

Historically, the climatic divisions were based mostly on the differences in vegetation types around the globe. The Koppen-Terawata classification [ref] is the most widely known climate classification and bases its divisions in obtaining the vegetation thresholds from precipitation and temperature data. Some authors had already pointed the limitations of this classification method mostly due to two aspects: the first one is that vegetation thresholds are not well defined and that could be an issue when higher spatial resoultion scales want to be defined. On the other hand is the fact that not only precipitation and temperature are influencing the vegetation species but also other atmospheric variables like solar irradiation, as well as other environmental factors that could be related to antropoghenic emissions or waste.

%{\color{red}{Buscar más biblio de esto}}

As these classical division are not adapted to the necessities of different fields and could be even biased, another way to geo-spatial classification is needed. In this sense it has become frequent to sucessfully use data-driven classification of different variables if it is necessary to give an spatially resolved answer. [ref]

\subsection{Applied clustering method}

In this work a clustering method is applied to classify solar irradiation due to the fact that classical climate divisions are only based on temperature an precipitation. The spatial pattern tha could be extract from the Koppen-Terawatta classification, can not be used for our pourpose.

A partitional commonly used clustering method has been selected to classify solar irradiation of the area. The \textbf{'k-means'} algorithm is easy to implement, due to the fact tha has been largely used over the literature. Moreover, the combination of a \textbf{principal component analysis} of the dataset previous to the k-means algorithm application has been proved to be an useful tool to reduce the data-dimensionality and apply the algorithm in a more efficient manner.[ref]

\subsubsection{K-Means algorithm}

The k-means algorithm is a partitional clustering method that provide a set of partitions from the application of an optimization function, usually the euclidean distance, \ref{eq:euclidean}. The algorithm initiates from a pre-defined number of clusters, 'k', and randomly selects a group of centroids equal to the number of clusters. The optimization function is applied to assign each object to one of the clusters, depending on the similarity (distance) to each of the centroids. This proccess is applied until the algorithm converges.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:euclidean}
    J =\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{n}{||x_i-c_j||}^2
\end{equation}

One of the limitations of these method is its dependency on the first selection of the centroids, that could lead to a local optimum instead to a global optimum. To solve this difficulty, the algorithm can be run many times to test the sensitivity of the algorithm to a different initial conditions. Another option is to use an initialization technique to select the centroids.

As the number of clusters 'k' is not normally known in advance, the algorithm is applied from 2 to 'n' times, with 'n' high enough to get the whole variability of the dataset and the optimum number of clusters is defined afterwards. This optimum 'k' will define the number of clusters that explain most of the variability and will assure that the increase in the number of clusters does not improve the variance representation. [ref]

\subsubsection{Principal Component Analysis}

The Principal Component Analysis, PCA [ref], consists in a decomposition of the dataset into a number of vectors whose linear combination represents the original data. The transformation of the original data into a lower dimensional space is a reduction of the dimensionality retaining the maximum of the data variance.

The new orthogonal system has in its first coordinate axis, the projected values of the original data that preserve most of the variance in the dataset, and it is called the principal component. The rest of principal components decrease the amount of variance explained consecutively.

The PCA has been applied in advance to K-means clustering algorithm among the literature [ref]. It was explained by [ref] that the reduction in dimensionality is directly linked to K-means due to the fact that the clustering membership indicators are actually the eigenvectors given by the PCA. For this reason, it has been applied before the K-means algorithm fastening the algorithm.

\subsubsection{Validity Index}

Clustering validation through the validation or validity index measures the goodness of the clustering results. As well as the clustering techniques, there is a classification for the methods used to validate the clustering results.

External validation techniques use information outside the dataset involved, whereas the internal validation techniques only need the information that is present in the data. The external methods knows the number of optimal clusters in advance, so they are applied to select the best clustering algorithm. On the other hand, the internal validation methods will give us the optimum number of clusters after the application of the selected algorithm and only use the information that rely on the data.

Two different index are used in this study, the \textbf{Calinski-Harabasz} index (Eq.:\ref{eq:calinski}), the \textbf{Davies-Bouldien} index (Eq.:\ref{eq:davies}), and the L-method proposed by Salvador and Chan, 2005 [ref].

In the equation \ref{eq:calinski}: The 'BCSM' is the Between-Cluster-Scatter-Matrix, and its trace is the sum of squares distances between each cluster center $c_{i}$ and the global centroid vector of all the objects of the dataset. The term 'WCSM' is the Within-Cluster-Scatter-Matrix and the trace of this matrix is the sum of squares of the distances between the objects inside each cluster and the centroid. 'k' is the number of clusters. In the equation \ref{eq:davies}: $d_{i}$ is the averaged distance between the data clasiffied to class i and the clauster center $c_{i}$ and $d(c_i,c_j)$ is the distance between the different cluster centers. 'k' is the number of clusters. 

Similar results are obtained with the CH and DB indexes. In order to analyse the optimum partiton, is important to consider the nature of the variables that we are analysing. Most of the atmospheric variables, are continious variables that could be closely related to other variables such as latitude. For that reason, the regionalization procedure can not be applied like for other discrete or non-continuous data. That characteristics should be considerd when the results have to be evaluated.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:calinski}
    CH =\frac{trace_{BCSM}}{trace_{WCSM}}\times\frac{n-k}{k-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:davies}
    DB =\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i-1}^{k}\max_{i=1,...i\neq{j}}{\frac{d_{i}+d_{j}}{d(c_i,c_j)}}
\end{equation}

\section{Simulating a photovoltaic system}

Photovoltaic energy is based in the conversion of incident solar energy into electricity. This process is made by the photovoltaic systems whose basic unit that transform solar radiation intro electricity is the \textbf{solar cell.}\\

The process of simulating a photovoltaic system has two main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, it is necessary to estimate the amount of energy that reaches solar cells. This energy will be defined as \textbf{global effective irradiation}: $G_{eff}(\alpha, \beta)$. It is the energy available to be transformed into electricity after being transposed to the tilted plane of the generator and to be account for the optical losses.
  \item Secondly, the amount of energy that the system is able to give depends on the electrical performance of its components. The effect of temperature in cell's efficiency is considered as well as the inverter behaviour.
  \end{enumerate}
  
Both stages involve some modeling assumptions and each one would be explained in detail in the following sections. In general, due to the fact that it is very unlikely to obtain solar radiation measurements in the plane-of-array, $G(\alpha, \beta)$; global horizontal irradiation, $G(0)$ (the most common variable measured or modeled that can be obtain from different sources), will be the starting point of the simulation. In order to estimate the amount of energy that reaches the generator surface, $G(\alpha, \beta)$, it is necessary to do a transposition of the different radiation components from the horizontal plane $G(0)$ to the plane of the array (POA).

Once the solar irradiation components at the generator surface are calculated, it will be assessed how much of that energy can be transformed into electricity. The relative position between the generator and the sun gives the optical losses according to the difference with the optimum incident angle. After considering the optical losses the plane of array irradiation becomes the global effective irradiation $G_{eff}(\alpha, \beta)$.
% In order to estimate the amount of energy produced by a photovoltaic system it is necessary first to assess the amount of energy that reach the generator surface (plane of array irradiation, $G(\alpha, \beta)$) and after this estimation, which it is not straightforward unless it is measured, the different components of the generator has to be modeled.\\

The second step that will calculate the energy output will indicate the performance of the electrical components from the global effective irradiation and other variables that can influence on cells, like ambiance temperature. The whole photovoltaic system includes the generator, the inverter and the transmission elements and wires.

% For the evaluation of the photovoltaic \textbf{energy yield}, defined as the amount of energy produced by a photovoltaic system divided by its nominal power, along this work we use the process explained below, which can be summarized in two steps:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item To calculate the \textbf{effective irradiation}, $G_{eff}(\alpha, \beta)$, which is the effective irradiation after substract optical losses, due to reflection, angle of incidence or dirtiness. The assessment of this variable has to be done from the global irradiation at the surface, $G(0)$, that can be obtain from measurements, atmospheric models or satellite datasets.
% \item The second step consists in simulate the \textbf{electrical performace} of the system and estimate the power from the generator. The whole photovoltaic system includes the generator, the inverter and the transmission elements and wires.
% \end{enumerate}

All the processes involved in the stage of simulating a photovoltaic system in this thesis have been made using solaR [ref], an R package that implements all the necessary functions to estimate the energy provided by the system.

\subsection{Global effective irradiation}

Assessing the amount of energy reaching cells of the photovoltaic generator requires to compute trackers movements, as well as the relative position between sun and panels throughout the year. These equations are computed making use of the solaR [] package. After that, the procedure is described below:\\

First, global irradiation on the horizontal plane is decomposed in two components, \textbf{direct} and \textbf{diffuse} irradiation, Eq.\ref{GlobalIrradiation}. The third component of global irradiaiton, the albedo, it is  not consider because its contribution is very low. To estimate these quantities we will consider equations proposed by \cite{Liu1960} to characterize solar irradiation. Definition of \textit{clearness index}, Eq.\ref{K.indicedeclaridad}, is the ratio between global irradiation and extra-terrestrial irradiation at the horizontal plane. They also proposed to relate that index with the \textit{diffuse fraction}: the ratio of diffuse to global irradiation in Eq.\ref{F.diffusefraction}. This relation varies depending on the time scale. For daily values, we estimate correlation between the clearness index and the diffuse fraction using equations in \cite{Aguiar1992}. After that, the diffuse component is obtained with the definition of the \textit{diffuse fraction}, Eq.\ref{F.diffusefraction}.

\begin{equation}\label{GlobalIrradiation}
G_{d}(0) = B_{d}(0) + D_{d}(0)
\end{equation}

\nomenclature[G]{$G(0)$}{Global irradiance on the horizontal plane.}
\nomenclature[Gd]{$G_{d}(0)$}{Daily global irradiation on the horizontal plane.}
\nomenclature[D]{$D(0)$}{Diffuse irradiance on the horizontal plane.}
\nomenclature[Dd]{$D_{d}(0)$}{Daily diffuse irradiation on the horizontal plane.}
\nomenclature[B]{$B(0)$}{Direct (beam) irradiance on the horizontal plane.}
\nomenclature[Bd]{$B_{d}(0)$}{Daily direct (beam) irradiation on the horizontal plane.}


\begin{equation}\label{F.diffusefraction}
F_{D,d}=\frac{D_{d}(0)}{G_{d}(0)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{K.indicedeclaridad}
K_{Td}=\frac{G_d(0)}{B_{0d}(0)}
\end{equation}

Secondly, daily irradiance $[\si{\watt\per\metro\squared}]$ has to be estimated from irradiation values $[\si{\watt\hour\per\metro\squared}]$. Considering low variability of solar irradiance, it is assumed that average irradiance in a short interval coincides with irradiation in that interval. Regarding equations proposed by \cite{Aguiar1992}, the ratio of the diffuse irradiance to diffuse irradiation is assumed to be equivalent to the ratio of extraterrestrial irradiance to extraterrestrial irradiation Eq.\ref{ratioB0}, and the ratio of global irradiance to daily global irradiation is followed from the same reference Eq.\ref{ratioG0}. 

\begin{equation}\label{ratioB0}
r_{D}=\frac{D(0)}{D_d(0)}=\frac{B_0(0)}{B_{0d}(0)}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}\label{ratioG0}
r_G=\frac{G(0)}{G_d(0)}=r_D\cdot(a+b\cdot\cos(\omega))
\end{equation}

\nomenclature[Ktd]{$K_{Td}$}{Clearness index.}
\nomenclature[Fd]{$F_{D,d}$}{Diffuse fraction.}
\nomenclature[B0]{$B_0(0)$}{Direct (beam) extra-terrestrial irradiation.}
\nomenclature[B0d]{$B_{0d}(0)$}{Daily direct (beam) irradiation.}

The third step considers only geometrical criteria to compute the direct and diffuse irradiance components at the inclined plane. Diffuse irradiance is calculated with the anisotropic model proposed in \cite{hay1985estimating}.

The last step estimates the effective irradiance incident on a generator subtracting dust and angle of incidence losses from the incident irradiance with the model proposed in \cite{Martin2001}.

In figure \ref{fig:algorithm_outline} the steps to assess effective irradiation at the plane-of-array is summarized.

\subsection{Photovoltaic energy yield}

% En el modelo de FV, dentro del generador FV, hay que explicar un poco mejor el efecto de la temperatura: 
% Por una parte, hay que indicar que los valores nominales son en unas condiciones (las denominadas STC) adecuadas para el laboratorio, pero que no se producen en el funcionamiento real. Por tanto, hay que modificar estos valores STC al funcionamiento real. También hay que distinguir entre tensión de circuito abierto y MPP, y corriente de cortocircuito y MPP. La potencia es el producto de Vmpp e Impp. A continuación, se indica que la Isc depende de la irradiancia, y la Voc de la temperatura. Estos dos efectos corrigen los valores nominales (condiciones STC), pero para obtener los valores Vmpp e Impp hay que trasladar los valores Isc y Voc a la curva del módulo/generador (hay varios procedimientos, pero no es necesario entrar en detalle aquí).

Once the effective irradiation that reaches solar cells is being assessed, the transformation into power output depends on some factors regarding the photovoltaic system. The term ``yield'', commonly used, is defined as the energy produced by the power nominal power of the system $[\si{\watthour\per\wattpeak}]$. That energy, comes from the integration in each time step of the power output of the photovoltaic system.

Considering that a photovoltaic generator is composed by modules, the generator nominal power output is calculated by multiplying the power output of a single module by the number of them, assuming the same electric performance of all modules. 

\begin{equation}\label{Pout}
P_{out}=I_{m} \cdot V_{m}
\end{equation}

\nomenclature[P_out]{$P_{out}$}{Power output from the photovoltaic module}
\nomenclature[Im]{$I_m$}{Intensity from the photovoltaic module}
\nomenclature[Vm]{$V_m$}{Voltage of a photovoltaic module}

The nominal values of the photovoltaic generator are defined by the manufacturer regarding the performance of the modules under certain conditions. However under operating conditions its performance varies and the power obtain depends on how the real conditions affect the cells.

The characterization of the solar cells that composed the modules is made by its I-V curve. The maximum power given by a solar cell can be obtained deriving that curve.

\begin{equation}\label{Tcelula}
\frac{dP}{dV}=0
\end{equation}

This point is called the MPP point and the current and voltage corresponding to this point are the Impp and Vmpp. The nominal power output of a module comes from the product of $I_{mpp}$ and $V_{mpp}$. The standard conditions applied to characterize the solar cells, thus the modules are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $T_c$=25ºC
  \item G=800 $[\si{\watt\per\metro\squared}]$
  \item AM=1,5
\end{itemize}

The characteristic equation of a solar cell and a module depends on two parameters called: the short-circuit current, $I_{sc}$ (eq. \ref{eq:Isc}) and the open circuit voltage, $V_{oc}$ (eq. \ref{eq:Voc}). This two parameters are respectively affected by the incident irradiation and the cell temperature. When the module is exposure to real conditions, the Impp and Vmpp are different from those under STC conditions. The Impp and Vmpp can be obtain from the $I_{sc}$ and the $V_{oc}$ and the standard $I_{mpp }$ and $V_{mpp}$, from now on: $I_{mpp}^*$ and $V_{oc}^*$:

\begin{equation}\label{Tcelula}
  I_{sc}=G_{eff}(\alpha, \beta)\cdot\frac{I_{sc}^*}{G_{STC}}
  \label{eq:Isc}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{Tcelula}
V_{oc}(T)=V_{oc}^*+(T_c-T_c^*)\frac{dV_{oc}}{T_{c}}
\label{eq:Voc}
\end{equation}

%* Explicar aquí lo que es el nominal power output. Este valor se obtiene a partir de las ecuaciones del generador en condiciones STC de laboratorio. En condiciones normales, no se reproducen las condiciones STC, por lo que hay que corregirlos. De ahí la ecuacion de la temperatura.

The open circuit voltage decrease linearly with cell temperature. Due to that, cells performance depends on cells temperature that is related to ambient temperature as it is showed in eq. \ref{eq:Tc}

The assumption used to this assessment consider a linear relationship between cell temperature and global effective irradiation, Eq.\ref{Tcelula}. NOCT in equation \ref{Tcelula} is considered constant being the temperature of a cell when it works under conditions of incident irradiance of 800 $[\si{\watt\over\metro^2}]$ and ambient temperature of 20ºC.

\begin{equation}\label{Tcelula}
T_c=T_a + G_{eff}(\alpha, \beta) \cdot \frac{NOCT-20}{800}
\label{eq:Tc}
\end{equation}

\nomenclature[T_c]{$T_c$}{Cell temperature}
\nomenclature[T_a]{$T_a$}{Ambient temperature}
\nomenclature[G_ef]{$G_{ef}$}{Global effective irradiation}

Once the power of the generator is calculated, the power output of the whole system is assessed by the consideration of a common inverter for transforming DC current into AC, also arrangement losses of the generator are included. Other systems factors that influence the performance of the photovoltaic system are shadows over the generator due to the positions of the PV modules over the land. This factor is not consider in our calculations assuming that we look for an estimation of the potential yield of an area, not the product of a real PV plant. Detailed description of the software employed to the assessment, solaR, is in \cite{Lamigueiro2012}. The process for the photovoltaic output is summarized in table \ref{tabla1} including all the steps and elements involved as explained in \cite{Perpinan2009}.

\section{Using Regional Climate Models}

%La cadena de modelado necesaria para obtener una estimación de la producción fotovoltaica puede incrementarse introduciendo como input una estimación o una salida de otro modelo (meteorológico, climático...) en lugar de observaciones. Este paso aumentará la incertiumbre de la potencia entregada por el sistema, pero merece la pena tomarla en consideración teniendo en cuenta la escasez de estaciones de medida que proporcionan datos de radiación.\\
The modeling chain to obtain an estimation of the photovoltaic production of a system starts with the input of the PV model. We can consider the output of an atmospheric or climate model as the input of the PV system instead of solar radiation measurements. The uncertainity of the PV power output will be increased but it is worth it to consider this option because it is possible to make sensitivity studies and also to analyse future projections.
 
%En nuestro contexto, en el cual la longitud de las series temporales es clave\footnote{el estudio climático es la evaluación del comportamiento medio de las distintas variables a lo largo del tiempo, su variabilidad y tendencias. Para poder definir una climatología se considera en consenso que son necesarios 30 años da datos.}, los modelos climáticos son una herramienta que permite evaluar el recurso presente, su evolución futura así como server de input en la cadena de modelado para estimar la potencia entregada por un sistema fotovotaico.\\  

In our context, with the purpose of analysing solar radiation and the potential PV production form a climatological point of view, climate models are a good tool that allow us to evaluate the resource in present conditions as well as its future evolution and to understand the role of aerosols in solar resource variability.

The history of climate modeling has been linked to the computational development since its beginning. The mathematical representation of the climate system was a consequence of the advance in numerical weather prediction models that took place for the first time in Princeton in 1952 and that had a fast grow. [ref]% and {\color{red}develop a bit more?}].

Climate modeling is based on a 3-D representation of the whole climatic system, where the Earth is divided  in a 3-D spatial grid whose size or resolution has evolved in time with computational power. Equations of motion, momentum and conservation laws are solved for each gridbox. As some of the atmospheric processes occurs in a finer spatial scale than the resolution of the model, parametrizations are needed for some processes such as convection. These models were first named as General Circulation Models, GCM, as their aimed was to represent main circulation flows in the atmosphere, but the development of more complex models that would start to include ocean and land, would name later these models as \textbf{Global Climate Models, GCMs}. 

Since its origins, there has been a diversification and more research groups has developed its own climate models. Also, many international framework initiatives has unify efforts to understand better the future evolution of climate with the intensification and promotion of research collaboration programs that include all the models (WCRP, IPCC, CLIVAR...)   
%``L. F. RichardsonZ was the first to promote the idea that future weather could be predicted by numerically integrating the equations of fluid motion using the present weather as the initial condition.  The first successful numerical forecasts used a  set of equations that are greatly simplified compared to Richardson’s and for which the solution is less sensitive to the initial conditions.''

Global climate models provides useful information about the possible evolution of climate in large scales. Their horizontal resolution, however, covers areas with very different regional characteristics, which potentially miss some information that affect in a particular manner to smaller and vulnerable areas.

It was in the early 90s (Dickinson 1989 and Giorgi 1990) when it was proposed to use global models as the necessary boundary conditions to force a 'limited area model LAM'. Those LAMs had been used for numerical weather prediction forecast, but they were applied to predict the weather just few days in advance. The idea of run these simultaions for longer periods will result in the evolution of \textbf{Regional Climate Modeling}, what would provide regional climate information of processes that occurs in a spatial scale not resolved by a global models.

In a similar way than the GCMs, RCMs community has expanded in last decades and the number of research groups has increased. Also, some international initiatives try to engage different groups and modellers to develop better models and simulations (PRUDENCE, ENSEMBLES,CORDEX, EURO-CORDEX, MED-CORDEX).

In the present work we make use of RCMs focused on the Mediterranean area with finner resolution than GCMs, considering the models and simulations included in the EURO-CORDEX and MED-CORDEX projects.

These RCMs can provide the necessary atmospheric variables for the analysis of renewable energy resources. Due to its complexity and the need of parametrizations for some atmospheric processes, they can have sistematic bias that make difficult to use them for resource assessment. However, due to the low frequency variability observed in some variables and to the importance of considering the future projections, they are a valuable tool for analysing renewable energy resources and its evolution. Besides, the use of climate models allows to study specific climatic events and to understand its mechanisms, linking the implications of those situations with renewable generation.

Climate simulations from RCMs can be forced by a Global Model, GCM, or by a reanalysis. Reanalysis are model-based climate products for present and past conditions that asimilate observational data [ref]. These climate data is usually used to force historical simulation runs of regional climate models, in order to evaluate the RCMs performance in present climate conditions and analyse its bias compared with other RCMs. This historical runs are sometimes called evaluation runs. For future conditions, RCMs are then forced by a GCMs that provide the contour conditions for the future.  

For chapter 6, ``Impact of aerosols in photovoltaic energy production'', only one RCMs is used. Three different simulations are used in this chapter in order to quantify the sensitivity of PV energy production to changes in atmospheric aerosols content in present and past climatic conditions. The simulations are nested in the ERA-Interim reanalysis and centered in the Mediterranean area, with the domain described by the MED-CORDEX initiative. The simulations length and characteristics of the aerosols dataset included are explained in detailed in the corresponding chapter.

Behind the comprehensive study of the climate system it is not only the interest of a deeper understanding of the physics processes but also there is a concern about the impact that a changing climatic system could have in the ecosystems and different species of the Earth.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, was launched in 1992 and it is an international organism that was founded by the World Meteorological Asociation, WMO, and the United Nations Environmental Program, UNEP. Its purpose was to gather together all the scientific information available about the anthropogenic climate change. This information will summarize our knowdlege about climate change, its impacts as well as some mitigation strategies were elaborated.

In order to elaborate the climate scenarios, which means the possible evolution of the climate system based on the actual climate conditions and models, it is necessary also to generate different plaussible scenarios of emissions. The development of these emission scenarios of greenhouse gases or aerosols will be based on the assumptions about technological changes or demographic criterias as well as the socioeconomic development of each region. Those scenarios, with different options for the future evolution, will be the driving force for the climate simulations in order to elaborate the climate projections.

The first emission scenarios were elaborated in the 90s and they have changed since then. For the 5th AR of the IPCC, that was released 2014 were defined the RCP scenarios. They are different 'representative concentrations pathaways' that correspond to the one of the possible scenarios that leads to an specific radiative forcing, i.e, the RCP8.5 represents a radiative forcing of 8.5 $[\si{\watt\per\metro^2}]$.

For chapter 7, ``Future projections for PV technology'', several RCMs and its correspondin GCMs are used. The simulations include the historical period and the future scenario RCP8.5 or RCP4.5. The analysis of the results will be done with respect to a reference historical period.

In table \ref{climatemodels} there is a summary of the climate models and the simulations that are used in chapter 6 and 7.

% * Los modelos climáticos proporcionan las variables atmosféricas necesarias para el análisis del recurso de energías renovables. Debido a su complejidad y la necesidad de parametrizar ciertos procesos, pueden contener sesgos importantes que dificulten su utilización como modelos para evaluación de recurso. Sin embargo, debido tanto a la variabilidad de baja frecuencia observada en muchas variables del sistema (global dimmimg and brigthenning) como a la importancia de considerar las distintas proyecciones de cambio climático, se han convertido en una herramienta importante para considerar la evolución de los recursos. Además, su uso permite estudiar eventos climáticos concretos y entender sus mecanismos, permitiendo estudiar las implicaciones de esas situaciones en la generación renovable.\\


%The first idea of modeling the climatic system came from ..
%The climate system is modeled by Global Climate Models, GCMs, that represents the climate system in a 3-dimensional way.
%``Global climate models are three‐dimensional representations of the climate system and its components. Using mathematical equations, climate models can simulate the exchange of air, water, and energy between components, given user‐specified input parameters. Using model validation techniques and sensitivity studies, climate modelers can assess a model's accuracy in simulating global climate change as well as establish a cause‐and‐effect relationship between various climate drivers and observed changes. Projections of future global climate change can be obtained by specifying different scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. Output from global climate models can take the form of a time series of global change in a particular climate variable (such as temperature), or of a global map depicting the spatial pattern of change in that variable at a future point in time. A great deal of uncertainty is associated with climate modeling, stemming from unknown future emissions, intermodel uncertainty, and uncertainty about various climate processes.''
