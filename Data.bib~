abstract = {This study characterizes the spatiotemporal variability and relative contribution of different types of aerosols to the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Eastern Mediterranean as derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra (March 2000–December 2012) and Aqua (July 2002–December 2012) satellite instruments. For this purpose, a 0.1° × 0.1° gridded MODIS dataset was compiled and validated against sun photometric observations from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). The high spatial resolution and long temporal coverage of the dataset allows for the determination of local hot spots like megacities, medium-sized cities, industrial zones and power plant complexes, seasonal variabilities and decadal averages. The average AOD at 550 nm (AOD550) for the entire region is ∼ 0.22 ± 0.19, with maximum values in summer and seasonal variabilities that can be attributed to precipitation, photochemical production of secondary organic aerosols, transport of pollution and smoke from biomass burning in central and eastern Europe and transport of dust from the Sahara and the Middle East. The MODIS data were analyzed together with data from other satellite sensors, reanalysis projects and a chemistry–aerosol-transport model using an optimized algorithm tailored for the region and capable of estimating the contribution of different aerosol types to the total AOD550. The spatial and temporal variability of anthropogenic, dust and fine-mode natural aerosols over land and anthropogenic, dust and marine aerosols over the sea is examined. The relative contribution of the different aerosol types to the total AOD550 exhibits a low/high seasonal variability over land/sea areas, respectively. Overall, anthropogenic aerosols, dust and fine-mode natural aerosols account for ∼ 51, ∼ 34 and ∼ 15 {\%} of the total AOD550 over land, while, anthropogenic aerosols, dust and marine aerosols account ∼ 40, ∼ 34 and ∼ 26 {\%} of the total AOD550 over the sea, based on MODIS Terra and Aqua observations.},

abstract = {The increase in the photovoltaic energy installed capacity over the world leads to the need of a better understanding of solar resource and its variability. The aim of this work is to assess the influence of aerosols on photovoltaic energy production from seasonal to multi-decadal time scales. For this purpose we use various coupled aerosol-climate simulations that take into account the complex spatial and temporal patterns of natural and anthropogenic aerosols over the Euro-Mediterranean domain. The results show that aerosols strongly influence the spatial pattern, seasonal cycle and long-term trend of PV production. The most affected area is Central Europe where sensitivity of PV production to aerosols is higher. The annual production loss due to aerosols ranges from no impact to -16{\%} in The Netherlands, with variation depending on the area and on the typology of the tracking system. The summer production loss can even reach -20{\%} over regions of Africa and Syria-Iraq. We conclude that aerosols cannot be neglected in the assessment of PV production at large time scales over the Euro-Mediterranean area. Besides, the potential increase in energy due to reduction in the anthropogenic aerosols is shown in the simulation of the brightening period over Europe, with an increase of 2000 [Formula presented] in a PV lifetime for the most affected areas. It illustrates the evolution that PV potential could follow in highly polluted areas through the effective implementation of pollution control measures.},

abstract = {Renewable energy resources are variable by nature. Due to this fact conventional electricity systems, which were designed for centralized generation, have to follow a different management approach when a big share of these technologies take part into the system. The space-time variability characteristics of solar radiation, wind and precipitation are very different and a detailed understanding of them is important for an adequate planning and management of the electricity system. This paper is focused on solar irradiation as source of energy for photovoltaic (PV) generation, but the proposed scheme can generally be applied to other renewable resources and different solar irradiation applications. A comprehensive methodology to analyze variability and complementarity of solar resource and PV production among sub-regions of a wide area is developed. The photovoltaic energy yield is defined as kWh per kW installed, which facilitates the comparison among sub-regions and allows a comparison with other renewable energies like solar thermoelectric or wind energy. The multi-step approach facilitates the spatial evaluation and comparison among areas and it could be applied to different time resolutions, from a short term analysis to climatological perspective as well as a climate change projections analysis. The main steps of the method are the application of an objective clustering method for performing a regionalization of the whole domain, the analysis of the temporal variability of solar radiation and photovoltaic energy yield, and the intercomparison of the obtained clusters for examining their complementarity. As an implementation example, we make use of 30years of daily satellite data, which is usually considered as the time for defining a climatology, and a long-term overview of solar variability is analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). In this region, the internal interconnections of the electrical system are strong, but the external interconnections are rather limited. The spatial distribution and variability of photovoltaic (PV) power yield is calculated for different tracking systems. The variability is analyzed on an interannual time scale, which is relevant for energy supply security and year-to-year price stability. The interannual variability shows robustness and stability of solar radiation and PV production on average for the whole domain, but with significant differences among clusters that could allow spatial compensation of PV production. The relationship between the variability of solar irradiation and of PV yield is not uniform among the different clusters. Areas where solar irradiation is higher are more sensitive to tracking type. The whole process described in the article provides the information of how solar resource and the PV energy yield perform in a limited area and provide the tools to analyze the relationships between sub-areas and their variability. In this sense, this method can be applied for isolated or nearly isolated electric systems located in regions with a variety of climates, or for interconnected systems involving several countries.},

abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation is expanding rapidly in China, with total capacity projected to be 400 GW by 2030. However, severe aerosol pollution over China reduces solar radiation reaching the surface. We estimate the aerosol impact on solar PV electricity generation at the provincial and regional grid levels in China. Our approach is to examine the 12-year (2003–2014) average reduction in point-of-array irradiance (POAI) caused by aerosols in the atmosphere. We apply satellite-derived surface irradiance data from the NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) with a PV performance model (PVLIB-Python) to calculate the impact of aerosols and clouds on POAI. Our findings reveal that aerosols over northern and eastern China, the most polluted regions, reduce annual average POAI by up to 1.5 kWh/m2 per day relative to pollution-free conditions, a decrease of up to 35{\%}. Annual average reductions of POAI over both northern and eastern China are about 20–25{\%}. We also evaluate the seasonal variability of the impact and find that aerosols in this region are as important as clouds in winter. Furthermore, we find that aerosols decrease electricity output of tracking PV systems more than those with fixed arrays: over eastern China, POAI is reduced by 21{\%} for fixed systems at optimal angle and 34{\%} for two-axis tracking systems. We conclude that PV system performance in northern and eastern China will benefit from improvements in air quality and will facilitate that improvement by providing emission-free electricity.},

abstract = {The Earth?s radiation budget is essential for driving the general circulation of the atmosphere and ocean, and for building the main conditions for the Earth's climate system. To detect changes in the Earth?s surface radiation field the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and its central archive - the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) - was created in 1992. BSRN is a project of the Radiation Panel (now the Data and Assessment Panel) from the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) under the umbrella of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). It is the global baseline network for surface radiation for the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), contributing to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW), and forming a cooperative network with the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The data are of primary importance in supporting the validation and confirmation of satellite and computer model estimates. At a relatively small number of stations (currently 58) in contrasting climatic zones, solar and atmospheric radiation is measured with instruments of the highest available accuracy and with high temporal resolution (mainly 1 minute). A total of about 7000 station-month datasets were available in the WRMC in mid 2013. All data are interactively accessible to external users for bona fide research purposes at no cost. This report provides information for scientists interested in high quality surface radiation data as well as for scientists running a BSRN station. It offers information about the available data, the data access and describes tools to visualize the data and to check their quality.},

abstract = {Reanalysis data sets have become a popular data source for large-scale wind power analyses because they cover large areas and long time spans, but those data are uncertain representations of "true" wind speeds. In this work we develop a model that systematically quantifies the uncertainties across many sites and corrects for biases of the reanalysis data. We apply this model to 32 years of reanalysis data for 1002 plausible wind-plant sites in the U.S. Great Plains to estimate variability of wind energy generation and the smoothing effect of aggregating distant wind plants. We find the coefficient of variation (COV) of annual energy generation of individual wind plants in the Great Plains is 5-12{\%}, but the COV of all those plants aggregated together is 3.0{\%}. The year-to-year variability (of interest to system planners) shows a maximum step change of {\~{}}10{\%}, and the wind power varies by ±7.5{\%} over a 32-year period. Similarly, the average variability of quarterly cash flow to equity investors in a single wind plant is 29{\%}, but that can be reduced to 18-21{\%} by creating small portfolios of two wind plants selected from regions with low correlations of wind speed.},

abstract = {Solar energy is one of the more abundant sources of renewable energy. It would be desirable that it is more stable over time than other energies with high interannual variability like hydropower. In this study we analyse the interannual variability of sunshine hours and precipitation over Spain, with the aim of comparing the reliability of solar energy to hydropower. An analysis in this respect has not been done before. We have used data from almost 100 stations in the WMO-AEMET (Spanish State Agency for Meteorology) network, and have applied two indices, the coefficient of variability (CV) and the speed of convergence, defined as the number of years of data needed to fully characterize a site. The main result is that the interannual variability for sunshine hours is several times lower than for precipitation over most of Spain, with the exception of the northern coast. The southwestern peninsular area stands out in this respect. This area is characterized at the same time by the highest number of sunshine hours, high speed of convergence and a low maximum departure of annual sunshine hours from the long-term mean. All this make this area optimal and very reliable for placing solar power plants.},

abstract = {Renewable energies arise as part of both economic development plans and mitigation strategies aimed at abating climate change. Contrariwise, most renewable energies are potentially vulnerable to climate change, which could affect in particular solar and wind power. Proper evaluations of this two-way climate-renewable energy relationship require detailed information of the geographical location of the renewable energy fleets. However, this information is usually provided as total amounts installed per administrative region, especially with respect to future planned installations. To help overcome this limiting issue, the objective of this contribution was to develop the so-called CLIMIX model: a tool that performs a realistic spatial allocation of given amounts of both photovoltaic (PV) and wind power installed capacities and evaluates the energy generated under varying climate conditions. This is done over a regular grid so that the created scenarios can be directly used in conjunction with outputs of climate models. First, we used the 0.44° resolution grid defined for the EURO-CORDEX project and applied the CLIMIX model to spatially allocate total amounts of both unreported 2012 and future 2020 PV and wind power installations in Europe at the country level. Second, we performed a validation exercise using the various options for estimating PV and wind power production under the created scenarios that are included in the model. The results revealed an acceptable agreement between the estimated and the recorded power production values in every European country. Lastly, we estimated increases in power production derived from the future deployment of new renewable units, often obtaining non-direct relationships. This latter further emphasizes the need of accurate spatially-resolved PV and wind power scenarios in order to perform reliable estimations of power production.},

abstract = {Climate change alone influences future air pollution levels through modifications of gas-phase chemistry, transport, removal, and natural emissions. Hence, the goal of this study is to determine at what extent concentrations of air pollutants respond to changes over the Iberian Peninsula under a climate change scenario. The methodology includes the use of the regional modeling system MM5 (regional climate model version)-CHIMERE for two nested domains covering Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. Two time slices driven by ECHO-G global circulation model covering from 1991 to 2010 and 2071 to 2100 under the SRES A2 scenario have been compared. Climate change influences the concentrations of both gas-phase pollutants and aerosols through changes in temperature, precipitation, mixing height, transport, humidity, and oxidant levels. The trends of variation of ozone (changes up to 5 ppb, +10{\%} increase during summertime) and aerosols over southwestern Europe are influenced by the higher mean temperature modeled for the future climate (up to +5.4 K), since it favors the formation of secondary gas-phase products. It also enhances sulphates (+2 $\mu$g m-3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) (+2.5 $\mu$g m-3under SRES A2 scenario) and contributes to the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the 17{\%} percent decrease of precipitation modeled for 2071-2100 has a strong effect in the frequency of the washout and therefore in the levels of natural aerosols: the concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The analysis of the influence of future climatic variations on air quality needs of methods that give a space-time display of large atmospheric data related to air pollution. Here a new approach in order to assess the impacts of climate change on the patterns of variation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) over Europe is presented. The most widely used method of analysis (selected time-slices, future-minus-present method) is very sensitive to the chosen control and future periods because of the internal variability of the climate system. In order to overcome this limitation, full transient simulations for the period 1991-2100 under the SRES A2 scenario are analysed by the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) methodology in order minimise the uncertainty associated to the internal variability due to the longer time series obtained. The results indicate that the EOF1 accounts for around 30-45{\%} of the total variance for the SIA levels and points out a general increase of its trend over the entire domain (p{\textless} 0.005), except in the case of nitrate, whose change signal is not significant (p{\textgreater} 0.1). The correlation between SIA and meteorological parameters indicates that the trends and patterns of variation of aerosols are related to the higher temperature projected for the future climate. It favours the formation of sulphates and ammonium (increasing the concentrations of atmospheric oxidants) and the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the decreases in precipitation have a strong effect on the frequency of the washout and therefore in the levels of aerosols. The concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. The trend from a decreasing mixing height found in several areas of Europe is frequently related to a decrease in precipitation, representing an adding effect for the enhanced future SIA concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change may alter the geographical pattern and intensity of near-surface winds which are the "fuel" for wind turbines. In a context of fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within ±15 and ±20 {\%} by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will not exceed 5 and 15 {\%} in magnitude at the European and national scale respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy mix plans.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The correlations of Hottel, Whillier, Liu and Jordan between diffuse and hemispherical, and between instantaneous (hourly) values and daily totals of solar radiation are recalibrated against pyrheliometer data for five stations in the U.S. The validity of the Liu and Jordan approach is confirmed, and numerical inaccuracies of the original correlations are found to arise from three factors: (i) reliance on uncorrected measurements of diffuse insolation with pyranometer plus shade ring, (ii) use of a single value of extraterrestrial insolation for a whole month, and (iii) neglect of seasonal variations in the diffuse/hemispherical ratio. The new correlation for the daily total ratio of diffuse over hemispherical insolation agrees with results reported for India, Israel and Canada which included the shade ring correction. This suggests that latitude independence is a good approximation. The new correlations imply that the diffuse component is significantly larger than that predicted by the original formulas of Liu and Jordan. Analytical expressions are presented the parameters of which are obtained by a least squares fit to the data. The resulting formulas provide a complete description of the long term average insolation incident on surfaces of arbitrary orientation; the only meteorological input is the long term average daily total of hemispherical insolation on the horizontal surface. Comparison between model and data shows an accuracy better than 3 per cent for the long term average insolation available to solar correctors, both fixed and tracking. The model provides a framework for optimal matching between solar radiation and ideal concentrators (based on the principle of phase space conservation). In addition to computing radiation availability for solar collectors, the model can be used for calculating heating and cooling loads of buildings. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {We present an atmosphere–ocean regional climate model for the Mediterranean basin, called the PROTHEUS system, composed by the regional climate model RegCM3 as the atmospheric component and by a regional configuration of the MITgcm model as the oceanic component. The model is applied to an area encompassing the Mediterranean Sea and compared to a stand-alone version of its atmospheric component. An assessment of the model performances is done by using available observational datasets. Despite a persistent bias, the PROTHEUS system is able to capture the inter-annual variability of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) and also the fine scale spatio-temporal evolution of observed SST anomalies, with spatial correlation as high as 0.7 during summer. The close inspection of a 10-day strong wind event during the summer of 2000 proves the capability of the PROTHEUS system to correctly describe the daily evolution of SST under strong air–sea interaction conditions. As a consequence of the model's skill in reproducing observed SST and wind fields, we expect a reliable estimation of air–sea fluxes. The model skill in reproducing climatological land surface fields is in line with that of state of the art regional climate models.},

abstract = {A fully coupled regional climate system model (CNRM-RCSM4) has been used over the Mediterranean region to investigate the direct and semi-direct effects of aerosols, but also their role in the radiation--atmosphere--ocean interactions through multi-annual ensemble simulations (2003--2009) with and without aerosols and ocean--atmosphere coupling. Aerosols have been taken into account in CNRM-RCSM4 through realistic interannual monthly AOD climatologies. An evaluation of the model has been achieved, against various observations for meteorological parameters, and has shown the ability of CNRM-RCSM4 to reproduce the main patterns of the Mediterranean climate despite some biases in sea surface temperature (SST), radiation and cloud cover. The results concerning the aerosol radiative effects show a negative surface forcing on average because of the absorption and scattering of the incident radiation. The SW surface direct effect is on average −20.9 Wm−2 over the Mediterranean Sea, −14.7 Wm−2 over Europe and −19.7 Wm−2 over northern Africa. The LW surface direct effect is weaker as only dust aerosols contribute (+4.8 Wm−2 over northern Africa). This direct effect is partly counterbalanced by a positive semi-direct radiative effect over the Mediterranean Sea (+5.7 Wm−2 on average) and Europe (+5.0 Wm−2) due to changes in cloud cover and atmospheric circulation. The total aerosol effect is consequently negative at the surface and responsible for a decrease in land (on average −0.4 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C over Europe, and −0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C over northern Africa) and sea surface temperature (on average −0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C for the Mediterranean SST). In addition, the latent heat loss is shown to be weaker (−11.0 Wm−2) in the presence of aerosols, resulting in a decrease in specific humidity in the lower troposphere, and a reduction in cloud cover and precipitation. Simulations also indicate that dust aerosols warm the troposphere by absorbing solar radiation, and prevent radiation from reaching the surface, thus stabilizing the troposphere. The comparison with the model response in atmosphere-only simulations shows that these feedbacks are attenuated if SST cannot be modified by aerosols, highlighting the importance of using coupled regional models over the Mediterranean. Oceanic convection is also strengthened by aerosols, which tends to reinforce the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. In parallel, two case studies are presented to illustrate positive feedbacks between dust aerosols and regional climate. First, the eastern Mediterranean was subject to high dust aerosol loads in June 2007 which reduce land and sea surface temperature, as well as air--sea humidity fluxes. Because of northern wind over the eastern Mediterranean, drier and cooler air has been consequently advected from the sea to the African continent, reinforcing the direct dust effect over land. On the contrary, during the western European heat wave in June 2006, dust aerosols have contributed to reinforcing an important ridge responsible for dry and warm air advection over western Europe, and thus to increasing lower troposphere (+0.8 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C) and surface temperature (+0.5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C), namely about 15 {\{}{\%}{\}} of this heat wave.},

@article{Bartok2017,
abstract = {The objective of the present work is to compare the projections of surface solar radiation (SSR) simulated by four regional climate models (CCLM, RCA4, WRF, ALADIN) with the respective fields of their ten driving CMIP5 global climate models. First the annual and seasonal SSR changes are examined in the regional and in the global climate models based on the RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The results show significant discrepancies between the projected SSR, the multi-model mean of RCMs indicates a decrease in SSR of −0.60 W/m2 per decade over Europe, while the multi-model mean of the associated GCMs used to drive the RCMs gives an increase in SSR of +0.39 W/m2 per decade for the period of 2006--2100 over Europe. At seasonal scale the largest differences appear in spring and summer. The different signs of SSR projected changes can be interpreted as the consequence of the different behavior of cloud cover in global and regional climate models. Cloudiness shows a significant decline in GCMs with −0.24{\%} per decade which explains the extra income in SSR, while in case of the regional models no significant changes in cloudiness can be detected. The reduction of SSR in RCMs can be attributed to increasing atmospheric absorption in line with the increase of water vapor content. Both global and regional models overestimate SSR in absolute terms as compared to surface observations, in line with an underestimation of cloud cover. Regional models further have difficulties to adequately reproduce the observed trends in SSR over the past decades.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment (ChArMEx; {\textless}a href="http://charmex.lsce.ipsl.fr" target="{\_}blank"{\textgreater}http://charmex.lsce.ipsl.fr{\textless}/a{\textgreater}) is a collaborative research program federating international activities to investigate Mediterranean regional chemistry-climate interactions. A special observing period (SOP-1a) including intensive airborne measurements was performed in the framework of the Aerosol Direct Radiative Impact on the regional climate in the MEDiterranean region (ADRIMED) project during the Mediterranean dry season over the western and central Mediterranean basins, with a focus on aerosol-radiation measurements and their modeling. The SOP-1a took place from 11 June to 5 July 2013. Airborne measurements were made by both the ATR-42 and F-20 French research aircraft operated from Sardinia (Italy) and instrumented for in situ and remote-sensing measurements, respectively, and by sounding and drifting balloons, launched in Minorca. The experimental setup also involved several ground-based measurement sites on islands including two ground-based reference stations in Corsica and Lampedusa and secondary monitoring sites in Minorca and Sicily. Additional measurements including lidar profiling were also performed on alert during aircraft operations at EARLINET/ACTRIS stations at Granada and Barcelona in Spain, and in southern Italy. Remote-sensing aerosol products from satellites (MSG/SEVIRI, MODIS) and from the AERONET/PHOTONS network were also used. Dedicated meso-scale and regional modeling experiments were performed in relation to this observational effort. We provide here an overview of the different surface and aircraft observations deployed during the ChArMEx/ADRIMED period and of associated modeling studies together with an analysis of the synoptic conditions that determined the aerosol emission and transport. Meteorological conditions observed during this campaign (moderate temperatures and southern flows) were not favorable to producing high levels of atmospheric pollutants or intense biomass burning events in the region. However, numerous mineral dust plumes were observed during the campaign, with the main sources located in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, leading to aerosol optical depth (AOD) values ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 (at 440 nm) over the western and central Mediterranean basins. One important point of this experiment concerns the direct observations of aerosol extinction onboard the ATR-42, using the CAPS system, showing local maxima reaching up to 150 M m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} within the dust plume. Non-negligible aerosol extinction (about 50 M m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) has also been observed within the marine boundary layer (MBL). By combining the ATR-42 extinction coefficient observations with absorption and scattering measurements, we performed a complete optical closure revealing excellent agreement with estimated optical properties. This additional information on extinction properties has allowed calculation of the dust single scattering albedo (SSA) with a high level of confidence over the western Mediterranean. Our results show a moderate variability from 0.90 to 1.00 (at 530 nm) for all flights studied compared to that reported in the literature on this optical parameter. Our results underline also a relatively low difference in SSA with values derived near dust sources. In parallel, active remote-sensing observations from the surface and onboard the F-20 aircraft suggest a complex vertical structure of particles and distinct aerosol layers with sea spray and pollution located within the MBL, and mineral dust and/or aged North American smoke particles located above (up to 6–7 km in altitude). Aircraft and balloon-borne observations allow one to investigate the vertical structure of the aerosol size distribution showing particles characterized by a large size ({\&}gt; 10 µm in diameter) within dust plumes. In most of cases, a coarse mode characterized by an effective diameter ranging between 5 and 10 µm, has been detected above the MBL. In terms of shortwave (SW) direct forcing, in situ surface and aircraft observations have been merged and used as inputs in 1-D radiative transfer codes for calculating the aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF). Results show significant surface SW instantaneous forcing (up to −90 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at noon). Aircraft observations provide also original estimates of the vertical structure of SW and LW radiative heating revealing significant instantaneous values of about 5° K per day in the solar spectrum (for a solar angle of 30°) within the dust layer. Associated 3-D modeling studies from regional climate (RCM) and chemistry transport (CTM) models indicate a relatively good agreement for simulated AOD compared with observations from the AERONET/PHOTONS network and satellite data, especially for long-range dust transport. Calculations of the 3-D SW (clear-sky) surface DRF indicate an average of about −10 to −20 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (for the whole period) over the Mediterranean Sea together with maxima (−50 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) over northern Africa. The top of the atmosphere (TOA) DRF is shown to be highly variable within the domain, due to moderate absorbing properties of dust and changes in the surface albedo. Indeed, 3-D simulations indicate negative forcing over the Mediterranean Sea and Europe and positive forcing over northern Africa. Finally, a multi-year simulation, performed for the 2003 to 2009 period and including an ocean–atmosphere (O–A) coupling, underlines the impact of the aerosol direct radiative forcing on the sea surface temperature, O–A fluxes and the hydrological cycle over the Mediterranean.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Solar PV is rapidly growing globally, creating difficult questions around how to efficiently integrate it into national electricity grids. Its time-varying power output is difficult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems, leading to difficulty in understanding its potential and limitations. We demonstrate how the MERRA and MERRA-2 global meteorological reanalyses as well as the Meteosat-based CM-SAF SARAH satellite dataset can be used to produce hourly PV simulations across Europe. To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000 PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators. We find slightly better accuracy from satellite data, but greater stability from reanalysis data. We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries. The simulation code and the hourly simulations for all European countries are available freely via an interactive web platform, www.renewables.ninja.},

abstract = {Medicanes are cyclones over the Mediterranean Sea having a tropical-like structure but a rather small size, that can produce significant damage due to the combination of intense winds and heavy precipitation. Future climate projections, performed generally with individual atmospheric climate models, indicate that the intensity of the medicanes could increase under climate change conditions. The availability of large ensembles of high resolution and ocean--atmosphere coupled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, performed in MedCORDEX and EURO-CORDEX projects, represents an opportunity to improve the assessment of the impact of climate change on medicanes. As a first step towards such an improved assessment, we analyze the ability of the RCMs used in these projects to reproduce the observed characteristics of medicanes, and the impact of increased resolution and air-sea coupling on their simulation. In these storms, air-sea interaction plays a fundamental role in their formation and intensification, a different mechanism from that of extra-tropical cyclones, where the baroclinic instability mechanism prevails. An observational database, based on satellite images combined with high resolution simulations (Miglietta et al. in Geophys Res Lett 40:2400--2405, 2013), is used as a reference for evaluating the simulations. In general, the simulated medicanes do not coincide on a case-by-case basis with the observed medicanes. However, observed medicanes with a high intensity and relatively long duration of tropical characteristics are better replicated in simulations. The observed spatial distribution of medicanes is generally well simulated, while the monthly distribution reveals the difficulty of simulating the medicanes that first appear in September after the summer minimum in occurrence. Increasing the horizontal resolution has a systematic and generally positive impact on the frequency of simulated medicanes, while the general underestimation of their intensity is not corrected in most cases. The capacity of a few models to better simulate the medicane intensity suggests that the model formulation is more important than reducing the grid spacing alone. A negative intensity feedback is frequently the result of air-sea interaction for tropical cyclones in other basins. The introduction of air-sea coupling in the present simulations has an overall limited impact on medicane frequency and intensity, but it produces an interesting seasonal shift of the simulated medicanes from autumn to winter. This fact, together with the analysis of two contrasting particular cases, indicates that the negative feedback could be limited or even absent in certain situations. We suggest that the effects of air-sea interaction on medicanes may depend on the oceanic mixed layer depth, thus increasing the applicability of ocean--atmosphere coupled RCMs for climate change analysis of this kind of cyclones.},

abstract = {Med-CORDEX simulations over the period 1979--2011 are evaluated with regard to their capability to represent observed decadal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region and improve upon previous generation simulations from the ENSEMBLES project in their various experimental set-ups. Such an evaluation is needed to inform the use of these simulations and also future model development. For temperature, both Med-CORDEX and ENSEMBLES simulations tend to provide comparable results: they generally capture the sign and timing of the anomalies but not the amplitude. In general, no clear stratification appears when considering different types of Med-CORDEX regional modeling systems. Rather, it is remarkable that certain periods are poorly represented by all systems with a general underestimation of the observed long-term temperature trend, mostly in the summer season, even with respect to the corresponding global drivers. For precipitation, the Med-CORDEX simulations are closer to observations than the other datasets, with some improvement with respect to ENSEMBLES dataset. In general, all the systems experience difficulties in representing anomalies during specific periods or for specific regions. These appear in part due to limitations in the reanalysis boundary forcing data. For instance, in the second part of 1980s, the spatial patterns of surface air temperature during DJF/MAM are generally poorly represented, as well as the regionally averaged MAM/JJA surface air temperature decadal anomalies. Overall, the evaluation suggests limited improvement in Med-CORDEX simulations compared to ENSEMBLES, and a lack of sensitivity to resolution or coupling configuration, with persisting problems in part likely related to the representation of surface processes that could also affect the viability of future projections (e.g. the estimation of temperature trends). A set of decadal variability evaluation metrics, as applied in this study, could be useful in the context of a broader evaluation framework.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the Mediterranean Sea heat budget components from a set of forced and coupled simulations performed in the frame of the Med-CORDEX project. The simulations use regional climate system models (RCSMs) dedicated to the Mediterranean area and driven by the ERA40/ERA-Interim reanalyses. The study focuses on the period 1980--2010. Interannual variations of the average net heat flux at the sea surface are consistent among models but the spread in the mean values is large (from −4.8 to +2.2 Wm−2) with the coupled models showing the lowest heat loss from the sea. For the heat flux at the Strait of Gibraltar both interannual variations and mean values show a large intermodel spread. The basin average temperature shows positive trends with highest values in the coupled models; it also shows interannual variations that are in good agreement with observations. The heat content rate is calculated based on the derivative of the average temperature and is found to be significantly correlated for most models with the net heat flux at the sea surface (average correlation {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.5) but not with the net heat flux through the Strait of Gibraltar (average correlation {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}0.2), suggesting that in the considered RCSMs the interannual variability of the heat content rate is mainly driven by the surface heat fluxes. The resemblance between the simulated and observed heat content rates is stronger in the forced models than in the coupled ones. This is explained by the stronger constraint applied to the forced models by the use of the surface temperature relaxation to observations. The temperature of the outflowing water through the Strait of Gibraltar shows positive and significant trends, also higher in the coupled models. It is suggested that the Mediterranean Sea warming found in most models and in particular in the coupled ones, induces a change of the hydrographic conditions that affects the Strait of Gibraltar.},

abstract = {Exploiting the added value of the ensemble of high-resolution model simulations provided by the Med-CORDEX coordinated initiative, an updated assessment of Mediterranean extreme precipitation events as represented in different observational, reanalysis and modelling datasets is presented. A spatiotemporal characterisation of the long-term statistics of extreme precipitation is performed, using a number of different diagnostic indices. Employing a novel approach based on the timing of extreme precipitation events a number of physically consistent subregions are defined. The comparison of different diagnostics over the Mediterranean domain and physically homogeneous sub-domains is presented and discussed, focussing on the relative impact of several model configuration features (resolution, coupling, physical parameterisations) on the performance in reproducing extreme precipitation events. It is found that the agreement between the observed and modelled long-term statistics of extreme precipitation is more sensitive to the model physics, in particular convective parameterisation, than to other model configurations such as resolution and coupling.},

abstract = {This study aims to assess the skill of regional climate models (RCMs) at reproducing the climatology of Mediterranean cyclones. Seven RCMs are considered, five of which were also coupled with an oceanic model. All simulations were forced at the lateral boundaries by the ERA-Interim reanalysis for a common 20-year period (1989--2008). Six different cyclone tracking methods have been applied to all twelve RCM simulations and to the ERA-Interim reanalysis in order to assess the RCMs from the perspective of different cyclone definitions. All RCMs reproduce the main areas of high cyclone occurrence in the region south of the Alps, in the Adriatic, Ionian and Aegean Seas, as well as in the areas close to Cyprus and to Atlas mountains. The RCMs tend to underestimate intense cyclone occurrences over the Mediterranean Sea and reproduce 24--40 {\{}{\%}{\}} of these systems, as identified in the reanalysis. The use of grid nudging in one of the RCMs is shown to be beneficial, reproducing about 60 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the intense cyclones and keeping a better track of the seasonal cycle of intense cyclogenesis. Finally, the most intense cyclones tend to be similarly reproduced in coupled and uncoupled model simulations, suggesting that modeling atmosphere--ocean coupled processes has only a weak impact on the climatology and intensity of Mediterranean cyclones.},

abstract = { AbstractThe Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and vulnerable climate change “hotspots” of the twenty-first century, and the physical mechanisms underlying this finding are still not clear. Furthermore, complex interactions and feedbacks involving ocean–atmosphere–land–biogeochemical processes play a prominent role in modulating the climate and environment of the Mediterranean region on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is critical to provide robust climate change information for use in vulnerability–impact–adaptation assessment studies considering the Mediterranean as a fully coupled environmental system. The Mediterranean Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Med-CORDEX) initiative aims at coordinating the Mediterranean climate modeling community toward the development of fully coupled regional climate simulations, improving all relevant components of the system from atmosphere and ocean dynamics to land surface, hydrology, and biogeochemical processes. The primary goals of Med-CORDEX are to improve understanding of past climate variability and trends and to provide more accurate and reliable future projections, assessing in a quantitative and robust way the added value of using high-resolution and coupled regional climate models. The coordination activities and the scientific outcomes of Med-CORDEX can produce an important framework to foster the development of regional Earth system models in several key regions worldwide. },

abstract = {In this paper, we report two human factors studies performed to investigate human performance in tasks involving dextrous manipulations of virtual objects with haptic feedback. These studies were performed at the Man-Machine Interface Laboratory (Rutgers University, NJ, USA) and at the Laboratoire de Robotique de Paris (CRIIF-LRP). Different haptic devices were used : the Rutgers Master, the LRP Force Feedback Glove (LRP), and the ITR device (Interface Technology Research, UK). These experiments involved (1) accurate placements of virtual objects and (2) grasping-force regulation. In the former case, we compared the LRP FFG (that provides complex haptic cueing) and the ITR device(that provides binary haptic cueing : grasped/not grasped). In the latter case, we investigated the effect of sensory substitution (synesthetic representation of haptic informations) to convey virtual haptic cues using the visual and auditory sensory channels. Results of the experiments showed that (1) information redundancy (display of visual or auditory force feedback in addition to finger force feedback) allowed to increase performance compared to finger force feedback alone, and (2) simple tactual feedback (provided by the ITR device) allowed similar performance than complex force feedback (provided by the LRP FFG). This result led us to think that complex force feedback cues are not required in simple manipulation task (i.e. when grasping regulation forces is not crucial). In this case binary haptic information could be sufficient},

abstract = {Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In parallel, AOD climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of this unique multiyear database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, seasalt, sulfate, black and organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products: NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS, ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth-Probe) and METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4, the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS and MACC. Ground-based Level- 2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this region, showing a relevant spatiotemporal variability and highlighting high dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations, which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology.We extend the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosolclimate studies.},

This decrease is often considered as the likely cause of the brightening effect observed over the same period. This phenomenon is however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain 81 ± 16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the surface warming simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct aerosol effect is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated brightening. The comparison between regional simulations and homogenized ground-based observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the realistic aerosol variations.},

abstract = {To support climate research, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) initiated a new radiometric network, the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). The network aims at providing validation material for satellite radi- ometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term variations in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play an important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN, consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S, and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to scientific communities in vari- ous ways depending on the communication environment of the users.

abstract = {The solar radiation model r.sun is a flexible and efficient tool for the estimation of solar radiation for clear-sky and overcast atmospheric conditions. In contrast to other models, r.sun considers all relevant input parameters as spatially distributed entities to enable computations for large areas with complex terrain. Conceptually the model is based on equations published in the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA). The r.sun model was applied to estimate the solar potential for photovoltaic systems in Central and Eastern Europe. The overcast radiation was computed from clear-sky values and a clear-sky index. The raster map of the clear-sky index was computed using a multivariate interpolation method to account for terrain effects, with inter- polation parameters optimized using a cross-validation technique. The incorporation of terrain data improved the radiation estimates in terms of the model's predictive error and the spatial pattern of the model outputs. Comparing the results of r.sun with the ESRA database demonstrates that integration of the solar radiation model and the spatial interpolation tools in a GIS can be especially helpful for data at higher resolutions and in regions with a lack of ground measurements.},

The CDRs are available free of charge for all purposes from wui.cmsaf.eu at monthly, daily and hourly means at a spatial resolution of 0.03.The processing employed a climate version of the Heliosat algorithm combined with a clear sky model using an eigenvector look-up table method. Modifications to the Heliosat method include a self-calibration algorithm as well as a running mean based clear sky retrieval algorithm.The datasets are validated using ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) as a reference. The validation threshold for the mean absolute bias between satellite-derived and surface-measured radiation is given by the target accuracy for solar irradiance fields defined by the Global Climate Observing system (GCOS) and a measurement uncertainty for the surface data. The results demonstrate that the target accuracy is achieved for monthly and daily means. Furthermore, an intercomparison with similar datasets reveal a better performance and climate monitoring potential of the CM SAF SIS CDR at most BSRN sites compared to established data sets like e.g. ERA-reanalysis, GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project). Lastly, the realistic representation of both seasonal and inter-annual variability guarantees the applicability of the satellite-based climate data sets for climate monitoring and analysis of extremes.No trends in the normalized bias between the CM SAF and the BSRN datasets are detectable, which demonstrates the stability and homogeneity of the global and direct irradiance for the period covered by BSRN measurements. However, inconsistencies are detectable at few satellite transition dates for certain regions in earlier years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic production is mostly driven by the solar irradiance received at ground level. Forecasting surface solar irradiance remains to predict the cloudiness and combine it with the value of the irradiance modeled under a clear sky for the same area at the same forecast horizon. Thus, uncertainty of irradiance under clear sky can affect significantly the photovoltaic production forecast. Clear sky irradiance can be accurately computed if concentration of some atmospheric components (aerosol, water vapor and ozone) are sufficiently known above a location. Many clear sky models have been designed allowing a various number of inputs. In this work, we analyzed the performance of four different clear sky models. We compared their outputs against ground measurements located in Reunion Island, Corsica and French Guiana. We used the models with atmospheric parameters provided by two different sources (neighboring ground measurements and reanalysis). Best results lead to a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 3 {\%} and an absolute relative mean bias error (rMBE) less than 1 {\%}, for minutely irradiance. Using atmospheric parameters from reanalysis instead of punctual measurements significantly reduces errors in clear sky models.},

abstract = {The importance for reliable forecasts of incoming solar radiation is growing rapidly, especially for those countries with an increasing share in photovoltaic (PV) power production. The reliability of solar radiation forecasts depends mainly on the representation of clouds and aerosol particles absorbing and scattering radiation. Especially under extreme aerosol conditions, numerical weather prediction has a systematic bias in the solar radiation forecast. This is caused by the design of numerical weather prediction models, which typically account for the direct impact of aerosol particles on radiation using climatological mean values and the impact on cloud formation assuming spatially and temporally homogeneous aerosol concentrations. These model deficiencies in turn can lead to significant economic losses under extreme aerosol conditions. For Germany, Saharan dust outbreaks occurring 5 to 15 times per year for several days each are prominent examples for conditions, under which numerical weather prediction struggles to forecast solar radiation adequately. We investigate the impact of mineral dust on the PV power generation during a Saharan dust outbreak over Germany at 4 April 2014 using ICON-ART, which is the current German numerical weather prediction model extended by modules accounting for trace substances and related feedback processes. We find an overall improvement of the PV power forecast for 65{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the pyranometer stations in Germany. Of the nine stations with very high differences between forecast and measurement, eight stations show an improvement. Furthermore, we quantify the direct radiative effects and indirect radiative effects of mineral dust. For our study, direct effects account for 64{\&}thinsp;{\%}, indirect effects for 20{\&}thinsp;{\%} and synergistic interaction effects for 16{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the differences between the forecast including mineral dust radiative effects and the forecast neglecting mineral dust.},

abstract = {Building large solar power plants requires significant long-term investment so understanding impacts from climate change will aid financial planning, technology selection, and energy output projections. In this article we examine how projected changes in temperature and insolation over the 21st century will affect photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) output. Projected climate data was obtained from the coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models HadGEM1 and HadCM3 under the IPCC SRES A1B scenario which describes a future world of rapid economic growth with a balanced use of renewable and fossil fuel power generation. Our calculations indicate that under this scenario PV output from 2010 to 2080 is likely to increase by a few percent in Europe and China, see little change in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. CSP output is likely to increase by more than 10{\%} in Europe, increase by several percent in China and a few percent in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. The results are robust to uncertainty in projected temperature change. A qualitative analysis of uncertainty in projected insolation change suggests strongest confidence in the results for Europe and least confidence in the results for western USA. Changes in PV and CSP output are further studied by calculating fractional contributions from changes in temperature and insolation. For PV there is considerable variation in contribution depending on location. For CSP the contribution from changes in insolation is always dominant.},

abstract = {The intrinsic performance of 18 broadband radiative models is assessed, using high-quality datasets from five sites in widely different climates. The selected models can predict direct, diffuse and global irradiances under clear skies from atmospheric data, and have all been (or still are) involved in large-scale applications, for instance to prepare solar resource maps and datasets, or to evaluate solar radiation in GIS software. The input data to the models include accurate aerosol and water vapor measurements by collocated sunphotometers, if needed. Cloud occurrences are meticulously scrutinized through the use of various tools to avoid cloud contamination of the test data. The intrinsic performance of the models is evaluated by comparison between their predictions and measurements at high frequency (1-minute time step at four sites, 3-minute at one site). The total expanded uncertainty of these measurements is estimated at 3{\%} for direct irradiance, and 5{\%} for diffuse and global irradiance.Various statistics are calculated to evaluate the systematic and random differences between the data series, as well as the agreement between the cumulative distribution functions. In the latter case, stringent statistics based on the Komolgorov-Smirnov (KS) test are used. Large differences in performance are apparent between models. Those that require more atmospheric inputs perform usually better than simpler models. Whereas many models can predict the global horizontal irradiance within uncertainty limits similar to those of the radiation measurements, the prediction of direct irradiance is less accurate. Moreover, the prediction of diffuse horizontal irradiance is particularly deficient in most models. The cumulative distribution functions also denote areas of concern.A ranking of all models is proposed, based on four statistical indicators: mean bias difference (MBD), root mean square difference (RMSD), total uncertainty with 95{\%} confidence limits (U 95), and the newly introduced Combined Performance Index (CPI), which optimally combines two KS indices with RMSD. For direct irradiance, consistently high rankings are obtained with five models (REST2, Ineichen, Hoyt, Bird, and Iqbal-C, in decreasing order of performance) that require a relatively large number of atmospheric inputs. The inferior performance of models requiring little or no atmospheric inputs suggests that large-scale solar resource products derived from them may be inappropriate for serious solar applications. Additionally, prediction uncertainties under ideal clear-sky conditions can propagate and affect all-sky predictions as well-resulting in potential biases in existing solar resource maps at the continent scale, for instance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The present study investigates the effects of aerosols on the Mediterranean climate daily variability during summer 2012. Simulations have been carried out using the coupled regional climate system model CNRM-RCSM5 which includes prognostic aerosols, namely desert dust, sea salt, organic, black-carbon and sulfate particles, in addition to the atmosphere, land surface and ocean components. An evaluation of the dust aerosol scheme of CNRM-RCSM5 has been performed against in-situ and satellite measurements. This scheme shows its ability to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region in summer 2012. Observations from the TRAQA/ChArMEx campaign also show that the model correctly represents dust vertical and size distributions. Thus CNRM-RCSM5 can be used for aerosol–climate studies over the Mediterranean. Here we focus on the effects of dust particles on surface temperature and radiation daily variability. Surface shortwave aerosol radiative forcing variability is found to be more than twice higher over regions affected by dust aerosols, when using a prognostic aerosol scheme instead of a monthly climatology. In this case downward surface solar radiation is also found to be better reproduced according to a comparison with several stations across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the radiative forcing due to the dust outbreaks also causes an extra cooling in land and sea surface temperatures. A composite study has been carried out for 14 stations across the Mediterranean to identify more precisely the differences between dusty days and the set of all the days. Observations show that dusty days receive less radiation at the surface and are warmer than average because of southwesterly fluxes often generating dust outbreaks. Only the simulation using the prognostic aerosol scheme is found to reproduce the observed intensity of the dimming and warming on dusty days. Otherwise, the dimming is underestimated and the warming overestimated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Due to the inherently stochastic nature of solar radiation, the question "How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this location over the next few years?" involves an exercise of prediction inevitably subjected to a degree of uncertainty. Moreover, during the life cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: "Is the system working correctly?". This paper proposes and examines several methods to cope with these questions. The daily performance of a PV system is simulated. This simulation and the interannual variability of both radiation and productivity are statistically analyzed. From the results several regression adjustments are obtained. This analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity prediction and performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical analysis of the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method of malfunctioning parts of the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although these losses are not always negligible, they are commonly not taken into account when correcting the electrical characteristics of the PV module or estimating the energy production of PV systems. The main reason of this approximation is the lack of easy-to-use mathematical expressions for the angular losses calculation. This paper analyses these losses on PV modules and presents an analytical model based on theoretical and experimental results. The proposed model fits monocrystalline as well as polycrystalline and amorphous silicon PV modules, and contemplates the existence of superficial dust.

Then, improvement of our knowledge of wind field variability is crucial to optimize the use of wind resources in a given region. Here, we quantify the effects of climate change on the surface wind speed field over the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands using an ensemble of four regional climate models driven by a global climate model. Regions of the Iberian Peninsula with coherent temporal variability in wind speed in each of the models are identified and analysed using cluster analysis. These regions are continuous in each model and exhibit a high degree of overlap across the models. The models forced by the European Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim) reanalysis are validated against the European Climate Assessment and Dataset wind. We find that regional models are able to simulate with reasonable skill the spatial distribution of wind speed at 10 m in the Iberian Peninsula, identifying areas with common wind variability. Under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B climate change scenario, the wind speed in the identified regions for 2031–2050 is up to 5{\%} less than during the 1980–1999 control period for all models. The models also agree on the time evolution of spatially averaged wind speed in each region, showing a negative trend for all of them. These tendencies depend on the region and are significant at p = 5{\%} or slightly more for annual trends, while seasonal trends are not significant in most of the regions and seasons.

abstract = {A method for identifying clusters of points in a multi - dimensional Euclidean space is described and its application to taxonomy considered. It reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek et al. (l951a), is constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by applying the criterion of minimum within-cluster sum of squares. This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a "variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by using the agglomerative method of Ward (1963) and the divisive method of Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).},

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for quanta, , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

abstract = {Australia has an abundant solar energy resource that is likely to be used for energy generation on a large scale. Variable sources of electricity generation require knowledge of the nature of their variability at all time scales. This study examines the effect that El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have on solar radiation in Australia, in order to establish the role for seasonal forecasting of solar power. Calendar years are classified into their ENSO state using a sea surface temperature index. The ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis products are then used to estimate the effect of ENSO on global horizontal solar irradiance over the continent. A bootstrap technique is used to obtain confidence regions for the effect in both winter and summer. The main impact of ENSO occurs during winter over a large part of eastern Australia. Little impact was observed over the continent during summer. A similar analysis is conducted for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) to ensure that the observed ENSO effect is not a manifestation of the IOD. This study indicates that the ENSO phenomenon may account for solar energy changes of more than 10{\%} in some locations on a seasonal basis. We show that the solar radiation analysis is directly applicable to solar energy yield. Knowledge of this variability may influence the location of large solar generation plants. Also, there is a potential to predict solar energy a few months ahead by means of seasonal forecasting systems, which would help to assist with planning for electricity grid. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the spatial and temporal changes in sunshine duration (SunDu) and total cloud cover (TCC) over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and four subregions during 1961-2004 using high-quality, homogenized data sets. The analyses confirm that over most of the IP and in most seasons, SunDu and TCC variations are strongly negatively correlated, with absolute values ∼0.8-0.9. Somewhat weaker correlations (0.5-0.6) are found in the southern portion of the IP in summer. A large discrepancy between the SunDu and TCC records occurs from the 1960s until the early 1980s when the SunDu series shows a decrease that it is not associated with an increase in TCC. This negative trend or "dimming" is even more pronounced after removing the effects of TCC via linear regression. Since the early 1980s, the SunDu and TCC residual SunDu series exhibit an upward trend or "brightening." In addition to the long-term dimming and brightening, the volcanic eruptions of El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo are clearly evident in the TCC residual SunDu record. The TCC and SunDu records over the IP are well correlated with sea level pressure (SLP), with above normal TCC and below normal SunDu corresponding to below normal SLP locally in all seasons. The TCC and SunDu related SLP changes over the IP in winter and spring are part of a larger-scale north-south dipole pattern that extends over the entire Euro-Atlantic sector. Other more regional atmospheric circulation, patterns, identified from rotated principal component analysis, are also linked to TCC and SunDu variations over the IP. Finally and perhaps surprisingly, the TCC residual SunDu series exhibits a statistically significant relationship with a regional atmospheric circulation pattern during spring, summer, and autumn.

On the basis of the annual means period 19701985, there is a statistically significant decline of 3.0{\%} decade1 (3.8 Wm2 decade1) followed by a nonsignificant rise of 0.3{\%} decade1 (0.4 Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. The behavior of the solar radiation for spring is similar to the annual series and has the strongest increase of 1.6{\%} decade1 (2.5 Wm2 decade1) during 19852000. In summer a similar evolution to the annual and spring time series is shown but has a stronger decline of 3.2{\%} decade1 (6.8 Wm2 decade1) during 19701985. A small positive nonsignificant trend is reported for the winter means time series while a statistically significant negative trend of 2.5{\%} decade1 (2.1 Wm2 decade1) was found in autumn during 19702000. By comparing variations in all-sky solar radiation with changes in cloud cover and NAO, we attribute the winter and autumn trends mainly to the NAO through the modification of mid-to-low cloud cover in southern Europe and the spring and summer trends to mid-to-low cloud cover in northern Europe. However, because the cloud cover and solar radiation relationship weakens in the low-frequency variability, it suggests that other effects such as aerosols may also play a role. In addition, aerosols could be interfering with the relationship between solar radiation and NAO, contributing to a strengthening of their correlation in the low-frequency variability during winter and autumn.},

Res. Lett. 8 044035 Abstract The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA) and the Scandinavian (SCAND) modes are the three main large-scale circulation patterns driving the climate variability of the Iberian Peninsula. This study assesses their influence in terms of solar (photovoltaic) and wind power generation potential (SP and WP) and evaluates their skill as predictors. For that we use a hindcast regional climate simulation to retrieve the primary meteorological variables involved, surface solar radiation and wind speed. First we identify that the maximum influence of the various modes occurs on the interannual variations of the monthly mean SP and WP series, being generally more relevant in winter. Second we find that in this time-scale and season, SP (WP) varies up to 30{\%} (40{\%}) with respect to the mean climatology between years with opposite phases of the modes, although the strength and the spatial distribution of the signals differ from one month to another. Last, the skill of a multi-linear regression model (MLRM), built using the NAO, EA and SCAND indices, to reconstruct the original wintertime monthly series of SP and WP was investigated. The reconstructed series (when the MLRM is calibrated for each month individually) correlate with the original ones up to 0.8 at the interannual time-scale. Besides, when the modeled series for each individual month are merged to construct an October-to-March monthly series, and after removing the annual cycle in order to account for monthly anomalies, these correlate 0.65 (0.55) with the original SP (WP) series in average. These values remain fairly stable when the calibration and reconstruction periods differ, thus supporting up to a point the predictive potential of the method at the time-scale assessed here.},

This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.},

Using the knee is well-known, but is not a particularly well-understood method to determine the number of clusters. We explore the feasibility of this method, and attempt to determine in which situations it will and will not work.

The WRF configuration consisted of a 10-km-resolution domain nested in a coarser domain driven by 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data, with spectral nudging above the PBL employed over the latter domain. The model outputs have been compared at different time scales with an observational dataset that comprises 438 rain gauges and 152 temperature stations with records of both daily maximum and minimum temperatures. To reduce the ‘‘representation error,'' the validation with observations has been performed using a multistep regionalization that distinguishes five precipitation regions and four temperature regions. The analysis proves that both cumulus and PBL schemes have a crucial impact on the description of precipitation in Andalusia, whereas no noticeable differences between microphysics options were appreciated. Temperature is described similarly by all the configurations, except for the PBL choice affecting minimum values. WRF provides a definite improvement over ERA-40 in the climate description in terms of frequency, spatial distribution, and intensity of extreme events. It also captures more accurately the annual cycle and reduces the biases and the RMSE for monthly precipitation, whereas only a minor enhancement of these features was obtained for monthly-mean maximum and minimum temperatures. The results indicate that WRF is able to correctly reproduce Andalusian climate and produces useful added-value information for climate studies.},

This is achieved through a holistic assessment that is based on a 10-km-resolution climate simulation spanning the period 1959–2007 that provides physically consistent data of the various magnitudes involved. A monthly analysis for the ex- tended winter (October–March) months shows that negativeNAOphases enhance wind speeds (10{\%}–15{\%}) and, thereby, wind power (estimated around 30{\%} at typical wind-turbine altitudes) and hydropower re- sources (with changes in precipitation exceeding 100{\%} and implying prolonged responses in reservoir storage and release throughout the year), while diminishing the solar potential (10{\%}–20{\%}). Opposite signals were also sporadically identified, being well explained when taking into account the orography and the prevailing wind direction during bothNAOphases.Anadditional analysis using real wind, hydropower, and solar power generation data further confirms the strong signature of the NAO.},

abstract = {Variations in solar radiation incident at Earth's surface profoundly affect the human and terrestrial environment. A decline in solar radiation at land surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from 1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the correlation between the fluctuations of the electrical power generated by the ensemble of 70. DC/AC inverters from a 45.6. MW PV plant. The use of real electrical power time series from a large collection of photovoltaic inverters of a same plant is an important contribution in the context of models built upon simplified assumptions to overcome the absence of such data. This data set is divided into three different fluctuation categories with a clustering procedure which performs correctly with the clearness index and the wavelet variances. Afterwards, the time dependent correlation between the electrical power time series of the inverters is estimated with the wavelet transform. The wavelet correlation depends on the distance between the inverters, the wavelet time scales and the daily fluctuation level. Correlation values for time scales below one minute are low without dependence on the daily fluctuation level. For time scales above 20. min, positive high correlation values are obtained, and the decay rate with the distance depends on the daily fluctuation level. At intermediate time scales the correlation depends strongly on the daily fluctuation level. The proposed methods have been implemented using free software.

abstract = {Since the 1980s anthropogenic aerosols have been considerably reduced in Europe and the Mediterranean area. This decrease is often considered as the likely cause of the brightening effect observed over the same period. This phenomenon is however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain 81 ± 16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the surface warming simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct aerosol effect is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated brightening. The comparison between regional simulations and homogenized ground-based observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the realistic aerosol variations.},

abstract = {Long-term solar irradiance modelled using monthly-average aerosol optical depth (AOD) is biased compared to what is obtained using daily AOD values. This is due to a modification of the AOD frequency distribution that results from the coarsening of the time scale, combined with the nonlinear sensitivity of irradiance to AOD. The resulting alteration of the mean and standard deviation of AOD has been evaluated worldwide in this study's Part 1. Here, the focus is to evaluate how the progressive coarsening (in 1-day steps) of the temporal representation of AOD affects the calculated long-term values of both global and direct irradiances. It is shown that, on average, their long-term values can be underestimated by as much as ???6??W??m???2 (???1.2{\%}) and ???40??W??m???2 (???8{\%}) respectively, over regions of North Africa and Asia, with respect to the reference case for which daily AODs are used. This irradiance underestimation can be parameterized as a function of the AOD time scale by means of four sitedependent parameters. The proposed parameterization provides a simple way to correct the long-term irradiance datasets that are commonly obtained using monthly-average AOD data.},

New challenges, arising from the variable nature of solar energy generation, must be tackled in order to keep a stable and balanced power grid. In this study, short term variability in power output due to changing intensity due to cloud cover is assessed for its impact on energy delivery. Studies on this subject conclude that while there may be local variability, there is a strong reduction in that variability when the aggregate of several PV systems is taken into account, rather than just one PV system. The analysis shows that the aggregated effect of many geographically dispersed systems PV systems yields a smoothing effect that reduces the impact of local variability.},

Solar power forecasting is then necessary to better exploit this variability and to increase the penetration of photovoltaic power into the energy mix. Solar energy forecasting involves prediction of cloud property above a given point. For several hour ahead forecasts, using images from meteorological geostationary satellite is the most suitable solution. We propose a forecasting method based on a phase correlation algorithm for motion estimation between subsequent cloud maps derived from Meteosat-9 images. The method is assessed against state-of-the-art over a limited area over South of France for a 4-hour period. Cloud index maps are predicted. Our forecasting are 21 {\%} better than persistence in relative RMSE of cloud index. If state-of-the-art shows better results (23 {\%}), our algorithm reduces computing of 25 {\%} and then minimize operational solar forecasting constraints.},

abstract = {Mineral dust aerosols exert a significant effect on both solar and terrestrial radiation. By absorbing and scattering, the solar radiation aerosols reduce the amount of energy reaching the surface. In addition, aerosols enhance the greenhouse effect by absorbing and emitting outgoing longwave radiation. Desert dust forcing exhibits large regional and temporal variability due to its short lifetime and diverse optical properties, further complicating the quantification of the direct radiative effect (DRE). The complexity of the links and feedbacks of dust on radiative transfer indicate the need for an integrated approach in order to examine these impacts. In order to examine these feedbacks, the SKIRON limited area model has been upgraded to include the RRTMG (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model – GCM) radiative transfer model that takes into consideration the aerosol radiative effects. It was run for a 6 year period. Two sets of simulations were performed, one without the effects of dust and the other including the radiative feedback. The results were first evaluated using aerosol optical depth data to examine the capabilities of the system in describing the desert dust cycle. Then the aerosol feedback on radiative transfer was quantified and the links between dust and radiation were studied. The study has revealed a strong interaction between dust particles and solar and terrestrial radiation, with several implications on the energy budget of the atmosphere. A profound effect is the increased absorption (in the shortwave and longwave) in the lower troposphere and the induced modifi- cation of the atmospheric temperature profile. These feedbacks depend strongly on the spatial distribution of dust and have more profound effects where the number of particles is greater, such as near their source.},

abstract = {Ground-based observations were carried out at the island of Lampedusa, in the central Mediterranean, simultaneously to measurements of the Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) instrument aboard the Terra satellite, in 2 days of July 2002 (14 and 16) when Saharan dust was present. Ground-based measurements include ultraviolet spectral irradiance; visible global and diffuse irradiances at several bands; aerosol optical depth in the ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared; aerosol backscattering; and depolarization profiles. The aerosol optical depth at 500 nm was very similar on both days (0.23). Large, irregular particles were present in the atmospheric layers between 2 and 6 km on 14 July and between 1 and 5 km on 16 July. According to backward trajectories, the airmasses arriving at Lampedusa spent a large fraction of the previous days over central Sahara on 14 July, while passing over northern Africa on 16 July. The different trajectories influence the value of the Angstrom exponent, depolarization, and backscattering produced by aerosols. A significant increase of the aerosol optical depth in the ultraviolet is observed, and is attributed to steep variations of the particles' refractive index. A radiative transfer model is used to reconstruct the observed radiative fluxes at the surface and the radiance at the satellite altitude, and to estimate the direct aerosol radiative forcing in the 290-800 nm and in the visible spectral range. The best agreement between measured and modeled radiative fluxes is found for values of the single scattering albedo of 0.96-0.97 (14 July) and 0.88-0.89 (16 July) and of the asymmetry parameter of 0.79-0.80 (14 July) and 0.81-0.82 (16 July), indicating that significantly different optical properties pertain to dust particles of different origin. The instantaneous direct radiative forcing per unit optical depth over the 400-700 nm spectral interval is -(39-79) W m(-2) at the surface and -(5-20) W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere. Although desert dust is the dominant aerosol type on both days, large differences, as large as a factor of 2 in the forcing efficiency at the surface and a factor of 3 at the top of the atmosphere, are found. Calculations were also performed to study the effect of nonspherical aerosol shapes by using different scattering phase functions, and comparing modeled and measured reflectivities at the nine observation angles of MISR. The different phase functions match the observed wavelength dependence of the aerosol optical depth and produce similar reflectance patterns for a scattering angle {\textless}150{\&}DEG;. The effect of nonspherical particles becomes important mainly at scattering angles in the 150-180{\&}DEG; interval. This effect should be taken into account in the derivation of radiation fluxes from satellite radiance measurements.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) applications, gaining worldwide interest during the last years, comprise a promising renewable energy based solution, able to considerably contribute to the constantly increasing energy demand of our planet. Currently, residential applications possess a considerable share of the global PV market since fiscal and practical incentives have reinforced their promotion. On the other hand, high population concentration, rapid industrialisation and economic development of urban areas all over the world have caused significant degradation of the urban air quality. In this context, the actual performance of five identical pairs of roof-top PV-panels, operating in the aggravated urban environment of Athens (from the atmospheric air pollution point of view), is currently evaluated. For this purpose, a series of systematic experimental measurements is conducted within a certain time period and the influence of different dust deposition densities on the energy yield and the economic performance of the small power station is estimated. According to the results obtained, the presence of dust considerably affects the PV-panels' performance since even a relatively small dust deposition density (???1g/m2) may result in remarkable energy losses corresponding almost to 40 ???/kWp on an annual basis. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Solar energy applications need global aerosol optical depth (AOD) information to derive historic surface solar irradiance databases from geostationary meteorological satellites reaching back to the 1980's. This paper validates the MATCH/DLR model originating in the climate community against AERONET ground measurements. Hourly or daily mean AOD model output is evaluated individually for all stations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East – an area highly interesting for solar energy applications being partly dominated by high aerosol loads. Overall, a bias of 0.02 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.23 are found for daily mean AOD values, while the RMSE increases to 0.28 for hourly mean AOD values. Large differences between various regions and stations are found providing a feedback loop for the aerosol modelling community. The difference in using daily means versus hourly resolved modelling with respect to hourly resolved observations is evaluated. Nowadays stateof- the-art in solar resource assessment relies on monthly turbidity or AOD climatologies while at least hourly resolved irradiance time series are needed by the solar sector. Therefore, the contribution of higher temporally modelled AOD is evaluated.},

Here we evaluate climate change impacts on solar photovoltaic (PV) power in Europe using the recent EURO-CORDEX ensemble of high-resolution climate projections together with a PV power production model and assuming a well-developed European PV power fleet. Results indicate that the alteration of solar PV supply by the end of this century compared with the estimations made under current climate conditions should be in the range (-14{\%};+2{\%}), with the largest decreases in Northern countries. Temporal stability of power generation does not appear as strongly affected in future climate scenarios either, even showing a slight positive trend in Southern countries. Therefore, despite small decreases in production expected in some parts of Europe, climate change is unlikely to threaten the European PV sector.},

abstract = {Traditionally, for the planning and assessment of solar energy systems, the amount of solar radiation (sunlight) incident on the Earth's surface is assumed to be constant over the years. However, with changing climate and air pollution levels, solar resources may no longer be stable over time and undergo substantial decadal changes. Observational records covering the past decades confirm long-term changes in this quantity. Here we examine how the latest generation of climate models used for the 5th IPCC report projects potential changes in surface solar radiation over the coming decades, and how this may affect, in combination with the expected greenhouse warming, solar power output from photovoltaic (PV) systems. For this purpose, projections up to the mid 21st century from 39 state of the art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analysed globally and for selected key regions with major solar power production capacity. The large model ensemble allows to assess the degree of consistency of their projections. Models are largely consistent in the sign of the projected changes in solar radiation under cloud-free conditions as well as surface temperatures over most of the globe, while still reasonably consistent over a considerable part of the globe in the sign of changes in cloudiness and associated changes in solar radiation. A first order estimate of the impact of solar radiation and temperature changes on energy yields of PV systems under the RPC8.5 scenario indicates statistically significant decreases in PV outputs in large parts of the world, but notable exceptions with positive trends in large parts of Europe, South-East of North America and the South-East of China. Projected changes between 2006 and 2049 under the RCP8.5 scenario overall are on the order of 1{\%}/decade for horizontal planes, but may be larger for tilted or tracked planes as well as on shorter (decadal) timescales.},

abstract = {This work presents a cluster analysis for the determination of coherent zones of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) for a utility scale territory in California, which is serviced by San Diego Gas {\&} Electric. Knowledge of these coherent zones, or clusters, would allow utilities and power plants to realize cost savings through regional planning and operation activities such as the mitigation of solar power variability through the intelligent placement of solar farms and the optimal placement of radiometric stations. In order to determine such clusters, two years of gridded satellite data were used to describe the evolution of GHI over a portion of Southern California. Step changes of the average daily clear-sky index at each location are used to characterize the fluctuation of GHI. The k-means clustering algorithm is applied in conjunction with a stable initialization method to diminish its dependency to random initial conditions. Two validity indices are then used to define the quality of the cluster partitions as well as the appropriate number of clusters. The clustering algorithm determined an optimal number of 14 coherent spatial clusters of similar GHI variability as the most appropriate segmentation of the service territory map. In addition, 14 cluster centers are selected whose radiometric observations may serve as a proxy for the rest of the cluster. A correlation analysis, within and between the proposed clusters, based both on single-point ground-based and satellite-derived measurements evaluates positively the coherence of the conducted clustering. This method could easily be applied to any other utility scale region and is not dependent on GHI data which shows promise for the application of such clustering methods to load data and/or other renewable resources such as wind. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

It would be desirable that it is more stable over time than other energies with high interannual variability like hydropower. In this study we analyse the interannual variability of sunshine hours and precipitation over Spain, with the aim of comparing the reliability of solar energy to hydropower. An analysis in this respect has not been done before. We have used data from almost 100 stations in the WMO-AEMET (Spanish State Agency for Meteorology) network, and have applied two indices, the coefficient of variability (CV) and the speed of convergence, defined as the number of years of data needed to fully characterize a site. The main result is that the interannual variability for sunshine hours is several times lower than for precipitation over most of Spain, with the exception of the northern coast. The southwestern peninsular area stands out in this respect. This area is characterized at the same time by the highest number of sunshine hours, high speed of convergence and a low maximum departure of annual sunshine hours from the long-term mean. All this make this area optimal and very reliable for placing solar power plants.},

abstract = {This work presents a validation of the downwelling surface shortwave radiation, or surface solar radiation (SSR), derived from the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) over Europe for a 23-year period of records on a monthly basis. This SSR product has been recently derived based on the visible channel of the Meteosat First Generation satellites, providing a dataset with a high spatial resolution (0.03°×0.03°) covering the 1983–2005 period. The CM SAF SSR product is compared against a homogeneous dataset of surface observations from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) over Europe, which has been homogenized by means of the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT). The results show a good agreement between both datasets (r2=0.86, p{\textless}0.01), with a slight overestimation (bias of +5.20Wm−2) of the CM SAF records as compared to the surface observations on a monthly mean basis. Equally, there is a monthly mean absolute bias difference (MABD) of 8.19Wm−2 that is below the accuracy threshold defined by the CM SAF. There is a clear maximum and minimum MABD during summer and winter, respectively, with an opposite cycle if the relative MABD values are considered. Moreover, the temporal stability of the CM SAF SSR is checked against the GEBA stations for the mean time series over Europe, as well as for each individual series. The results point to possible inhomogeneities in the CM SAF records around 1987 and 1994, possibly due to changes in the satellite instruments, although other factors such as the lack of aerosol retrievals in the CM SAF SSR are also discussed. Consequently, the study of the means and trends in the SSR derived from CM SAF is only recommended for the records after 1994.},

abstract = {This pair of articles presents the results of a study about forecasting photovoltaic (PV) electricity production for some power plants in mainland France. Forecasts are built with statistical methods exploiting outputs from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Contrary to most other studies, forecasts are built without using technical information on the power plants. In each article, several statistical methods are used to build forecast models and their performance is compared by means of adequate scores. When a best forecast emerges, its characteristics are then further assessed in order to get a deeper insight of its merits and flaws. The robustness of the results are evaluated with an intense use of cross-validation.This article deals with probabilistic forecasts of daily production 2. days ahead. By "probabilistic" we mean that our forecast models yield some quantiles of the expected production's probability distribution. Whereas probabilistic forecasts are quite usual in wind power forecasting, they are more unusual in the field of PV production forecasting. We show that our eight forecasts always perform better than a simple climatological reference forecast. Nevertheless, no forecast model clearly dominates the other, whatever the studied power plant. A post-processing technique aiming at improving forecasts may in fact decrease their performance. Finally, we use outputs from an ensemble NWP model in order to add information about the meteorological forecast uncertainty. Sometimes this ensemble improves the performance of forecasts, but this is not always true. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Though every power grid studied has exponential degree distribution and most of them lack typical small-world topology, they display patterns of reaction to node loss similar to those observed in scale-free networks. We have found that the node removal behavior can be logarithmically related to the power grid size. This logarithmic behavior would suggest that, though size favors fragility, growth can reduce it. We conclude that, with the ever-growing demand for power and reliability, actual planning strategies to increase transmission systems would have to take into account this relative increase in vulnerability with size, in order to facilitate and improve the power grid design and functioning.},

abstract = {The contribution of power production by photovoltaic (PV) systems to the electricity supply is constantly increasing. An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production. This forecast information is necessary for the management of the electricity grids and for solar energy trading. This paper presents an approach to predict regional PV power output based on forecasts up to three days ahead provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Focus of the paper is the description and evaluation of the approach of irradiance forecasting, which is the basis for PV power prediction. One day-ahead irradiance forecasts for single stations in Germany show a rRMSE of 36{\%}. For regional forecasts, forecast accuracy is increasing in dependency on the size of the region. For the complete area of Germany, the rRMSE amounts to 13{\%}. Besides the forecast accuracy, also the specification of the forecast uncertainty is an important issue for an effective application. We present and evaluate an approach to derive weather specific prediction intervals for irradiance forecasts. The accuracy of PV power prediction is investigated in a case study.},

abstract = {The massive deployment of grid-connected PV in recent years has brought PV penetration in the electricity grids to levels where the conventional fit-and-forget approach to interconnecting PV reaches its limits. In many cases, constraints and limitations of existing electricity infrastructure already have evolved to one of the key barriers delaying or impeding the realisation of PV projects. While until recently grid issues associated with increased PV Penetration levels have been an issue in just a few local markets mainly in Europe, it has since then become a truly global issue - attracting global interest and attendance. In many cases PV has already become a game - changer in the way utilities, transmission as well as distribution system operators plan and operate power system infrastructure. Last but not least the grid integration of High Penetration PV has been identified as key prerequisite for the future development of the world-wide solar industry. It is clear that resolving these global challenges requires the broad collaboration of experts from different stakeholders involved and the access to global information on experiences and best practises. Consequently, the Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme of the International Energy Agency (IEA-PVPS) has put up grid integration of on top of its research agenda, following its strategic mission "to enhance the international collaborative efforts which facilitate the role of photovoltaic solar energy as a cornerstone in the transition to sustainable energy systems". Coordinated by Task 14 "High Penetration PV in Electricity Grids" a worldwide group of experts has been working together exchanging expertise and developing innovative solutions addressing technical as well as non-technical challenges for the advanced integration of PV. From its beginning Task 14 has focused on working together with utilities, electricity industry, and leading research to develop the technologies and methods to enable the widespread deployment of distributed PV into the electricity system. Task 14 addresses integration challenges and technologies on two main levels of the power system, local distribution grids and the overall power transmission system. The present report specifically covers aspects related to distribution integration, presenting a worldwide selection of best-practice case studies and the latest findings from the working period from 2010 to 2013 within the IEA Task 14 Subtask 2. It enables the reader to deeply understand the fundamental characteristics of the national distribution grids and associated technical issues that are related to high PV penetration in the local power system. including current technical and regulatory interconnection requirements. Highlighting technically effective and economically efficient solutions for improved distribution grid integration of high levels of PV penetration, the report supports experts from utilities and industry as well as responsible authorities in their business to design, manage and effectively operate power distribution systems with High Penetration PV.},

Vietnam has a dense and long network of sunshine duration measurements, and on the contrary the country has a scarce availability of solar irradiance measuring sites. The variability of long term solar radiation can be analyzed by determining daily global irradiation from sunshine duration. A model inspired in Angstrom equation has been developed using the canonical correlation analysis with good performance. The output of the model has been used for characterizing the dispersion of long term solar radiation and its spatial distribution has been also studied by clustering techniques. The comparison with the K{\"{o}}ppen climatic information remarks that Vietnam could be divided into 3-4 well defined zones of different solar radiation variability.},

To this end, this paper has three main contributions. First, it proposes a new clustering method called CLARANS, whose aim is to identify spatial structures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, the paper investigates how CLARANS can handle not only point objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, the paper develops two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with existing spatial data mining algorithms.},

Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 22 ground-based instruments. The spatial representativeness of the proposed sites is also assessed. The proposed number of stations could be considered as the basis to build the climatology of surface solar irradiance over Greece. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose a novel methodology to select candidate locations for solar power plants that take into account solar variability and geographical smoothing effects. This methodology includes the development of maps created by a clustering technique that determines regions of coherent solar quality attributes as defined by a feature which considers both solar clearness and solar variability. An efficient combination of two well-known clustering algorithms, the affinity propagation and the k-means, is introduced in order to produce stable partitions of the data to a variety of number of clusters in a computationally fast and reliable manner. We use 15. years worth of the 30-min GHI gridded data for the island of Lanai in Hawaii to produce, validate and reproduce clustering maps. A family of appropriate number of clusters is obtained by evaluating the performance of three internal validity indices. We apply a correlation analysis to the family of solutions to determine the map segmentation that maximizes a definite interpretation of the distinction between and within the emerged clusters. Having selected a single clustering we validated the clustering by using a new dataset to demonstrate that the degree of similarity between the two partitions remains high at 90.91{\%}. In the end we show how the clustering map can be used in solar energy problems. Firstly, we explore the effects of geographical smoothing in terms of the clustering maps, by determining the average ramp ratio for two location within and without the same cluster and identify the pair of clusters that shows the highest smoothing potential. Secondly, we demonstrate how the map can be used to select locations for GHI measurements to improve solar forecasting for a PV plant, by showing that additional measurements from within the cluster where the PV plant is located can lead to improvements of 10{\%} in the forecast.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for unsupervised dimension reduction. K-means clustering is a commonly used data clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks. Here we prove that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering. New lower bounds for K-means objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. These results indicate that unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning. Several implications are discussed. On dimension reduction, the result provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data reductions, beyond the conventional noisereduction explanation that PCA, via singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear approximation of the data. On learning, the result suggests effective techniques for K-means data clustering. DNA gene expression and Internet newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results. Experiments indicate that the new bounds are within 0.5-1.5 of the optimal values.},

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners.

Here, the proposed approach is practically founded on a fast incremental algorithm validated by a normalized principal component analysis combined with a k-means process. Both methods are practically based on the definition of a Pearson correlation coefficient. The advantage of such a clustering methodology is mainly perceptible in large-scale electrical systems with increased wind penetration. Indeed, it allows to group together highly correlated wind parks into the same cluster and to integrate them in a realistic way into a nonsequential Monte Carlo adequacy evaluation process. Here, the implemented clustering methodology is applied to 94 wind sites located in Occidental Europe. Then, in order to point out the efficiency of this clustering methodology that is afterwards combined with an original wind speed sampling process, an adequacy study is applied to the Roy Billinton Test System in the particular case of two wind clusters.},

The database, with a resolution of 1 km × 1 km, consists of monthly and yearly averages of global irradiation and related climatic parameters, representing the period 1981-1990. The database has been used to analyse regional and national differences of solar energy resource and to assess the photovoltaic (PV) potential in the 25 European Union member states and 5 candidate countries. The calculation of electricity generation potential by contemporary PV technology is a basic step in analysing scenarios for the future energy supply and for a rational implementation of legal and financial frameworks to support the developing industrial production of PV. Three aspects are explored within this paper: (1) the expected average annual electricity generation of a 'standard' 1 kWp grid-connected PV system; (2) the theoretical potential of PV electricity generation; (3) determination of required installed capacity for each country to supply 1{\%} of the national electricity consumption from PV. The analysis shows that PV can already provide a significant contribution to a mixed renewable energy portfolio in the present and future European Union. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Integrating variable and non-dispatchable renewable power generation into existing power systems will have consequences for their operation and future expansion. These impacts will depend on two factors: (1) the variability of the total renewable power generation on different time scales and (2) the possibilities of accurately forecasting these fluctuations. In this paper, previous research on variability assessment and forecasting of solar, wind, wave and tidal energy resources is reviewed. The aim is to summarize the state of knowledge in each area and to compare the approaches used for the respective resources. For temporal variability, methods and models used for assessing the variability are surveyed, as well as what is known about the variability at individual sites and for larger aggregates of sites. For forecasting, an overview of forecasting methods for the different resources is made, and selected forecasting methods are compared over different time horizons. An important finding is that it is hard to draw strong conclusions from the existing studies due to differences in approaches and presentation of results. There is a need for further, more coherent studies that analyze the variability for the different resources in comparable ways, using data with the same resolution, and for studies that evaluate the smoothing effect and complementarity of combinations of several renewable energy resources. For forecasting, future research should suggest ways to evaluate forecasts from different renewable energy sources in easily comparable ways, using data from the same locations or regions, with the same temporal and spatial resolution, and with comparable metrics for the forecasting errors.},

abstract = {Proper quantification of the available solar resource is essential for the diverse development phases of any solar power plant. At local scale, the solar resource is best assessed from ground radiometric stations. At regional-to-continental scales, however, satellite-based techniques are currently the most suitable approach. Solar radiation evaluation using numerical weather prediction (NWP) models presents some advantages over satellite-based techniques. Nonetheless, gridded solar radiation estimates using either satellite-based or NWP-based techniques still produce biased estimates which are often much higher for the latter. Therefore, a correction needs to be applied before these gridded values are usable for solar applications, especially for NWP-based estimates. This contribution introduces an original method based on the optimal interpolation technique to adjust gridded solar radiation estimates consistently with concomitant radiometric ground observations. The method's performance is demonstrated using NWP-based gridded estimates with 10-km spacing of global and direct monthly irradiation data during the 10-year period from 2003 to 2012 over continental Spain and the Balearic Islands. It is shown that the proposed methodology produces adjusted gridded values that are (or nearly always are, in the case of direct irradiation) within the expected measurement uncertainty of the ground observations, provided a sufficiently large number of observations is available for correction. For the studied region and these NWP-based gridded datasets, our findings suggest that a homogeneous mean distance between ground observations of 100–150km can result in unbiased gridded estimates.},

abstract = {The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is responding to a growing demand for high-accuracy solar resource data with uncertainties significantly lower than those of existing solar resource datasets, such as the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Measurements for long-term solar resource characterizations require years to complete, which is an unacceptable timeline for the rapidly emerging needs of renewable energy applications. This contribution seeks methods of reducing the uncertainty of existing long-term solar resource datasets by incorporating lower-uncertainty site-specific ground measurements of a limited period of record. In particular, various techniques are being explored to make full use of the existing high-resolution radiation data available in the NSRDB and other sources, and extrapolate them over time using locally measured data and other supportive information. The interannual variability in global and direct radiation is studied here using long-term data at various sites. NSRDB's modeled data for the 1998-2005 period are compared to quality-controlled measurements to assess the performance of the model, which is found to vary greatly depending on climatic condition. The reported results are encouraging for applications involving concentrators at very sunny sites. Large seasonal biases are found at some cloudy sites. Various improvements are proposed to enhance the quality of the existing model and modeled data. The measurement of solar radiation to characterize the solar climate for renewable energy and other applications is a time consuming and expensive operation. Full climate characterization may require several decades of measurements-a prospect that is not practical for an industry intent on rapid deployment of solar technologies. This study demonstrates that the consistency of the solar resource in both time and space varies widely across the United States. The mapped results here illustrate regions with high and low variability and provide readers with quick visual information to help them decide where and how long measurements should be taken for a particular application. The underlying data that form these maps are also available from NREL to provide users the opportunity for more detailed analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production. This forecast information is necessary for the management of the electricity grids and for solar energy trading. This paper presents an approach to predict regional PV power output based on forecasts up to three days ahead provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Focus of the paper is the description and evaluation of the approach of irradiance forecasting, which is the basis for PV power prediction. One day-ahead irradiance forecasts for single stations in Germany show a rRMSE of 36{\%}. For regional forecasts, forecast accuracy is increasing in dependency on the size of the region. For the complete area of Germany, the rRMSE amounts to 13{\%}. Besides the forecast accuracy, also the specification of the forecast uncertainty is an important issue for an effective application. We present and evaluate an approach to derive weather specific prediction intervals for irradiance forecasts. The accuracy of PV power prediction is investigated in a case study.},

abstract = {Many countries and regions are introducing policies aimed at reducing the environmental footprint from the energy sector and increasing the use of renewable energy. In the United States, a number of initiatives have been taken at the state level, from renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) and renewable energy certificates (RECs), to regional greenhouse gas emission control schemes. Within the U.S. Federal government, new energy and environmental policies and goals are also being crafted, and these are likely to increase the use of renewable energy substantially. The European Union is pursuing implementation of its ambitious 20/20/20 targets, which aim (by 2020) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20{\%} (as compared to 1990), increase the amount of renewable energy to 20{\%} of the energy supply, and reduce the overall energy consumption by 20{\%} through energy efficiency. With the current focus on energy and the environment, efficient integration of renewable energy into the electric power system is becoming increasingly important. In a recent report, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) describes a model-based scenario, in which wind energy provides 20{\%} of the U.S. electricity demand in 2030. The report discusses a set of technical and economic challenges that have to be overcome for this scenario to unfold. In Europe, several countries already have a high penetration of wind power (i.e., in the range of 7 to 20{\%} of electricity consumption in countries such as Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark). The rapid growth in installed wind power capacity is expected to continue in the United States as well as in Europe. A large-scale introduction of wind power causes a number of challenges for electricity market and power system operators who will have to deal with the variability and uncertainty in wind power generation when making their scheduling and dispatch decisions. Wind power forecasting (WPF) is frequently identified as an important tool to address the variability and uncertainty in wind power and to more efficiently operate power systems with large wind power penetrations. Moreover, in a market environment, the wind power contribution to the generation portofolio becomes important in determining the daily and hourly prices, as variations in the estimated wind power will influence the clearing prices for both energy and operating reserves. With the increasing penetration of wind power, WPF is quickly becoming an important topic for the electric power industry. System operators (SOs), generating companies (GENCOs), and regulators all support efforts to develop better, more reliable and accurate forecasting models. Wind farm owners and operators also benefit from better wind power prediction to support competitive participation in electricity markets against more stable and dispatchable energy sources. In general, WPF can be used for a number of purposes, such as: generation and transmission maintenance planning, determination of operating reserve requirements, unit commitment, economic dispatch, energy storage optimization (e.g., pumped hydro storage), and energy trading. The objective of this report is to review and analyze state-of-the-art WPF models and their application to power systems operations. We first give a detailed description of the methodologies underlying state-of-the-art WPF models. We then look at how WPF can be integrated into power system operations, with specific focus on the unit commitment problem.},

abstract = {Wind power generation differs from conventional thermal generation due to the stochastic nature of wind. Thus wind power forecasting plays a key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing supply and demand in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the wind farm power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need for additional balancing energy and reserve power to integrate wind power. Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction. Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales, ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed. Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed. Then the techniques used for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis of forecasts are overviewed, and the performance of various approaches over different forecast time horizons is examined. Finally, current research activities, challenges and potential future developments are appraised. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The effect of output smoothing from dispersion of wind power plants is well established, but there is a need to study more renewables in combination. This study analyses large-scale solar and wind power in a future scenario for Sweden, using climatic data covering eight years with an hourly resolution. It is shown that solar and wind power are negatively correlated on all time scales, from hourly to annual, but that the correlation is strongest for monthly totals. Combining solar and wind power reduces total variations in terms of standard deviation, but hour-to-hour variability is always higher with a larger share of solar power.},

abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation is expanding rapidly in China, with total capacity projected to be 400 GW by 2030. However, severe aerosol pollution over China reduces solar radiation reaching the surface. We estimate the aerosol impact on solar PV electricity generation at the provincial and regional grid levels in China. Our approach is to examine the 12-year (2003–2014) average reduction in point-of-array irradiance (POAI) caused by aerosols in the atmosphere. We apply satellite-derived surface irradiance data from the NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) with a PV performance model (PVLIB-Python) to calculate the impact of aerosols and clouds on POAI. Our findings reveal that aerosols over northern and eastern China, the most polluted regions, reduce annual average POAI by up to 1.5 kWh/m2 per day relative to pollution-free conditions, a decrease of up to 35{\%}. Annual average reductions of POAI over both northern and eastern China are about 20–25{\%}. We also evaluate the seasonal variability of the impact and find that aerosols in this region are as important as clouds in winter. Furthermore, we find that aerosols decrease electricity output of tracking PV systems more than those with fixed arrays: over eastern China, POAI is reduced by 21{\%} for fixed systems at optimal angle and 34{\%} for two-axis tracking systems. We conclude that PV system performance in northern and eastern China will benefit from improvements in air quality and will facilitate that improvement by providing emission-free electricity.},

abstract = {Renewable energies arise as part of both economic development plans and mitigation strategies aimed at abating climate change. Contrariwise, most renewable energies are potentially vulnerable to climate change, which could affect in particular solar and wind power. Proper evaluations of this two-way climate-renewable energy relationship require detailed information of the geographical location of the renewable energy fleets. However, this information is usually provided as total amounts installed per administrative region, especially with respect to future planned installations. To help overcome this limiting issue, the objective of this contribution was to develop the so-called CLIMIX model: a tool that performs a realistic spatial allocation of given amounts of both photovoltaic (PV) and wind power installed capacities and evaluates the energy generated under varying climate conditions. This is done over a regular grid so that the created scenarios can be directly used in conjunction with outputs of climate models. First, we used the 0.44° resolution grid defined for the EURO-CORDEX project and applied the CLIMIX model to spatially allocate total amounts of both unreported 2012 and future 2020 PV and wind power installations in Europe at the country level. Second, we performed a validation exercise using the various options for estimating PV and wind power production under the created scenarios that are included in the model. The results revealed an acceptable agreement between the estimated and the recorded power production values in every European country. Lastly, we estimated increases in power production derived from the future deployment of new renewable units, often obtaining non-direct relationships. This latter further emphasizes the need of accurate spatially-resolved PV and wind power scenarios in order to perform reliable estimations of power production.},

abstract = {Climate change alone influences future air pollution levels through modifications of gas-phase chemistry, transport, removal, and natural emissions. Hence, the goal of this study is to determine at what extent concentrations of air pollutants respond to changes over the Iberian Peninsula under a climate change scenario. The methodology includes the use of the regional modeling system MM5 (regional climate model version)-CHIMERE for two nested domains covering Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. Two time slices driven by ECHO-G global circulation model covering from 1991 to 2010 and 2071 to 2100 under the SRES A2 scenario have been compared. Climate change influences the concentrations of both gas-phase pollutants and aerosols through changes in temperature, precipitation, mixing height, transport, humidity, and oxidant levels. The trends of variation of ozone (changes up to 5 ppb, +10{\%} increase during summertime) and aerosols over southwestern Europe are influenced by the higher mean temperature modeled for the future climate (up to +5.4 K), since it favors the formation of secondary gas-phase products. It also enhances sulphates (+2 $\mu$g m-3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) (+2.5 $\mu$g m-3under SRES A2 scenario) and contributes to the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the 17{\%} percent decrease of precipitation modeled for 2071-2100 has a strong effect in the frequency of the washout and therefore in the levels of natural aerosols: the concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The analysis of the influence of future climatic variations on air quality needs of methods that give a space-time display of large atmospheric data related to air pollution. Here a new approach in order to assess the impacts of climate change on the patterns of variation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) over Europe is presented. The most widely used method of analysis (selected time-slices, future-minus-present method) is very sensitive to the chosen control and future periods because of the internal variability of the climate system. In order to overcome this limitation, full transient simulations for the period 1991-2100 under the SRES A2 scenario are analysed by the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) methodology in order minimise the uncertainty associated to the internal variability due to the longer time series obtained. The results indicate that the EOF1 accounts for around 30-45{\%} of the total variance for the SIA levels and points out a general increase of its trend over the entire domain (p{\textless} 0.005), except in the case of nitrate, whose change signal is not significant (p{\textgreater} 0.1). The correlation between SIA and meteorological parameters indicates that the trends and patterns of variation of aerosols are related to the higher temperature projected for the future climate. It favours the formation of sulphates and ammonium (increasing the concentrations of atmospheric oxidants) and the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, remaining in the gas phase. Further, the decreases in precipitation have a strong effect on the frequency of the washout and therefore in the levels of aerosols. The concentrations of aerosols decrease with increasing precipitation as wet deposition provides the main aerosol sink. The trend from a decreasing mixing height found in several areas of Europe is frequently related to a decrease in precipitation, representing an adding effect for the enhanced future SIA concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change may alter the geographical pattern and intensity of near-surface winds which are the "fuel" for wind turbines. In a context of fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within ±15 and ±20 {\%} by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will not exceed 5 and 15 {\%} in magnitude at the European and national scale respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy mix plans.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The correlations of Hottel, Whillier, Liu and Jordan between diffuse and hemispherical, and between instantaneous (hourly) values and daily totals of solar radiation are recalibrated against pyrheliometer data for five stations in the U.S. The validity of the Liu and Jordan approach is confirmed, and numerical inaccuracies of the original correlations are found to arise from three factors: (i) reliance on uncorrected measurements of diffuse insolation with pyranometer plus shade ring, (ii) use of a single value of extraterrestrial insolation for a whole month, and (iii) neglect of seasonal variations in the diffuse/hemispherical ratio. The new correlation for the daily total ratio of diffuse over hemispherical insolation agrees with results reported for India, Israel and Canada which included the shade ring correction. This suggests that latitude independence is a good approximation. The new correlations imply that the diffuse component is significantly larger than that predicted by the original formulas of Liu and Jordan. Analytical expressions are presented the parameters of which are obtained by a least squares fit to the data. The resulting formulas provide a complete description of the long term average insolation incident on surfaces of arbitrary orientation; the only meteorological input is the long term average daily total of hemispherical insolation on the horizontal surface. Comparison between model and data shows an accuracy better than 3 per cent for the long term average insolation available to solar correctors, both fixed and tracking. The model provides a framework for optimal matching between solar radiation and ideal concentrators (based on the principle of phase space conservation). In addition to computing radiation availability for solar collectors, the model can be used for calculating heating and cooling loads of buildings. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

A set of three 50 km resolution simulations run over Western Europe with the LAM ALADIN-Climate and the GCM ARPEGE-Climate are performed to address this issue. Results are consistent with previous studies regarding the seasonal-mean fields.

abstract = {In this paper, we report two human factors studies performed to investigate human performance in tasks involving dextrous manipulations of virtual objects with haptic feedback. These studies were performed at the Man-Machine Interface Laboratory (Rutgers University, NJ, USA) and at the Laboratoire de Robotique de Paris (CRIIF-LRP). Different haptic devices were used : the Rutgers Master, the LRP Force Feedback Glove (LRP), and the ITR device (Interface Technology Research, UK). These experiments involved (1) accurate placements of virtual objects and (2) grasping-force regulation. In the former case, we compared the LRP FFG (that provides complex haptic cueing) and the ITR device(that provides binary haptic cueing : grasped/not grasped). In the latter case, we investigated the effect of sensory substitution (synesthetic representation of haptic informations) to convey virtual haptic cues using the visual and auditory sensory channels. Results of the experiments showed that (1) information redundancy (display of visual or auditory force feedback in addition to finger force feedback) allowed to increase performance compared to finger force feedback alone, and (2) simple tactual feedback (provided by the ITR device) allowed similar performance than complex force feedback (provided by the LRP FFG). This result led us to think that complex force feedback cues are not required in simple manipulation task (i.e. when grasping regulation forces is not crucial). In this case binary haptic information could be sufficient},

abstract = {Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In parallel, AOD climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of this unique multiyear database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, seasalt, sulfate, black and organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products: NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS, ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth-Probe) and METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4, the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS and MACC. Ground-based Level- 2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this region, showing a relevant spatiotemporal variability and highlighting high dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations, which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology.We extend the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the 2003{\&}{\#}8211;2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosolclimate studies.},

abstract = {Solar Energy Forecasting and Resource Assessment is a vital text for solar energy professionals, addressing a critical gap in the core literature of the field. As major barriers to solar energy implementation, such as materials cost and low conversion efficiency, continue to fall, issues of intermittency and reliability have come to the fore. Scrutiny from solar project developers and their financiers on the accuracy of long-term resource projections and grid operators?? concerns about variable short-term power generation have made the field of solar forecasting and resource assessment pivotally important. This volume provides an authoritative voice on the topic, incorporating contributions from an internationally recognized group of top authors from both industry and academia, focused on providing information from underlying scientific fundamentals to practical applications and emphasizing the latest technological developments driving this discipline forward.},

abstract = {Since the 1980s anthropogenic aerosols have been considerably reduced in Europe and the Mediterranean area. This decrease is often considered as the likely cause of the brightening effect observed over the same period. This phenomenon is however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain 81 ± 16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the surface warming simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct aerosol effect is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated brightening. The comparison between regional simulations and homogenized ground-based observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the realistic aerosol variations.},

abstract = {To support climate research, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) initiated a new radiometric network, the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). The network aims at providing validation material for satellite radi- ometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term variations in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play an important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN, consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S, and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to scientific communities in vari- ous ways depending on the communication environment of the users. The present article discusses the scientific base, organizational and technical aspects of the network, and data retrieval methods; shows various application possibilities; and presents the future tasks to be accomplished.},

abstract = {The solar radiation model r.sun is a flexible and efficient tool for the estimation of solar radiation for clear-sky and overcast atmospheric conditions. In contrast to other models, r.sun considers all relevant input parameters as spatially distributed entities to enable computations for large areas with complex terrain. Conceptually the model is based on equations published in the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA). The r.sun model was applied to estimate the solar potential for photovoltaic systems in Central and Eastern Europe. The overcast radiation was computed from clear-sky values and a clear-sky index. The raster map of the clear-sky index was computed using a multivariate interpolation method to account for terrain effects, with inter- polation parameters optimized using a cross-validation technique. The incorporation of terrain data improved the radiation estimates in terms of the model's predictive error and the spatial pattern of the model outputs. Comparing the results of r.sun with the ESRA database demonstrates that integration of the solar radiation model and the spatial interpolation tools in a GIS can be especially helpful for data at higher resolutions and in regions with a lack of ground measurements.},

The CDRs are available free of charge for all purposes from wui.cmsaf.eu at monthly, daily and hourly means at a spatial resolution of 0.03.The processing employed a climate version of the Heliosat algorithm combined with a clear sky model using an eigenvector look-up table method. Modifications to the Heliosat method include a self-calibration algorithm as well as a running mean based clear sky retrieval algorithm.The datasets are validated using ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) as a reference. The validation threshold for the mean absolute bias between satellite-derived and surface-measured radiation is given by the target accuracy for solar irradiance fields defined by the Global Climate Observing system (GCOS) and a measurement uncertainty for the surface data. The results demonstrate that the target accuracy is achieved for monthly and daily means. Furthermore, an intercomparison with similar datasets reveal a better performance and climate monitoring potential of the CM SAF SIS CDR at most BSRN sites compared to established data sets like e.g. ERA-reanalysis, GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project). Lastly, the realistic representation of both seasonal and inter-annual variability guarantees the applicability of the satellite-based climate data sets for climate monitoring and analysis of extremes.No trends in the normalized bias between the CM SAF and the BSRN datasets are detectable, which demonstrates the stability and homogeneity of the global and direct irradiance for the period covered by BSRN measurements. However, inconsistencies are detectable at few satellite transition dates for certain regions in earlier years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic production is mostly driven by the solar irradiance received at ground level. Forecasting surface solar irradiance remains to predict the cloudiness and combine it with the value of the irradiance modeled under a clear sky for the same area at the same forecast horizon. Thus, uncertainty of irradiance under clear sky can affect significantly the photovoltaic production forecast. Clear sky irradiance can be accurately computed if concentration of some atmospheric components (aerosol, water vapor and ozone) are sufficiently known above a location. Many clear sky models have been designed allowing a various number of inputs. In this work, we analyzed the performance of four different clear sky models. We compared their outputs against ground measurements located in Reunion Island, Corsica and French Guiana. We used the models with atmospheric parameters provided by two different sources (neighboring ground measurements and reanalysis). Best results lead to a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 3 {\%} and an absolute relative mean bias error (rMBE) less than 1 {\%}, for minutely irradiance. Using atmospheric parameters from reanalysis instead of punctual measurements significantly reduces errors in clear sky models.},

abstract = {The importance for reliable forecasts of incoming solar radiation is growing rapidly, especially for those countries with an increasing share in photovoltaic (PV) power production. The reliability of solar radiation forecasts depends mainly on the representation of clouds and aerosol particles absorbing and scattering radiation. Especially under extreme aerosol conditions, numerical weather prediction has a systematic bias in the solar radiation forecast. This is caused by the design of numerical weather prediction models, which typically account for the direct impact of aerosol particles on radiation using climatological mean values and the impact on cloud formation assuming spatially and temporally homogeneous aerosol concentrations. These model deficiencies in turn can lead to significant economic losses under extreme aerosol conditions. For Germany, Saharan dust outbreaks occurring 5 to 15 times per year for several days each are prominent examples for conditions, under which numerical weather prediction struggles to forecast solar radiation adequately. We investigate the impact of mineral dust on the PV power generation during a Saharan dust outbreak over Germany at 4 April 2014 using ICON-ART, which is the current German numerical weather prediction model extended by modules accounting for trace substances and related feedback processes. We find an overall improvement of the PV power forecast for 65{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the pyranometer stations in Germany. Of the nine stations with very high differences between forecast and measurement, eight stations show an improvement. Furthermore, we quantify the direct radiative effects and indirect radiative effects of mineral dust. For our study, direct effects account for 64{\&}thinsp;{\%}, indirect effects for 20{\&}thinsp;{\%} and synergistic interaction effects for 16{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the differences between the forecast including mineral dust radiative effects and the forecast neglecting mineral dust.},

abstract = {Building large solar power plants requires significant long-term investment so understanding impacts from climate change will aid financial planning, technology selection, and energy output projections. In this article we examine how projected changes in temperature and insolation over the 21st century will affect photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) output. Projected climate data was obtained from the coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models HadGEM1 and HadCM3 under the IPCC SRES A1B scenario which describes a future world of rapid economic growth with a balanced use of renewable and fossil fuel power generation. Our calculations indicate that under this scenario PV output from 2010 to 2080 is likely to increase by a few percent in Europe and China, see little change in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. CSP output is likely to increase by more than 10{\%} in Europe, increase by several percent in China and a few percent in Algeria and Australia, and decrease by a few percent in western USA and Saudi Arabia. The results are robust to uncertainty in projected temperature change. A qualitative analysis of uncertainty in projected insolation change suggests strongest confidence in the results for Europe and least confidence in the results for western USA. Changes in PV and CSP output are further studied by calculating fractional contributions from changes in temperature and insolation. For PV there is considerable variation in contribution depending on location. For CSP the contribution from changes in insolation is always dominant.},

abstract = {The intrinsic performance of 18 broadband radiative models is assessed, using high-quality datasets from five sites in widely different climates. The selected models can predict direct, diffuse and global irradiances under clear skies from atmospheric data, and have all been (or still are) involved in large-scale applications, for instance to prepare solar resource maps and datasets, or to evaluate solar radiation in GIS software. The input data to the models include accurate aerosol and water vapor measurements by collocated sunphotometers, if needed. Cloud occurrences are meticulously scrutinized through the use of various tools to avoid cloud contamination of the test data. The intrinsic performance of the models is evaluated by comparison between their predictions and measurements at high frequency (1-minute time step at four sites, 3-minute at one site). The total expanded uncertainty of these measurements is estimated at 3{\%} for direct irradiance, and 5{\%} for diffuse and global irradiance.Various statistics are calculated to evaluate the systematic and random differences between the data series, as well as the agreement between the cumulative distribution functions. In the latter case, stringent statistics based on the Komolgorov-Smirnov (KS) test are used. Large differences in performance are apparent between models. Those that require more atmospheric inputs perform usually better than simpler models. Whereas many models can predict the global horizontal irradiance within uncertainty limits similar to those of the radiation measurements, the prediction of direct irradiance is less accurate. Moreover, the prediction of diffuse horizontal irradiance is particularly deficient in most models. The cumulative distribution functions also denote areas of concern.A ranking of all models is proposed, based on four statistical indicators: mean bias difference (MBD), root mean square difference (RMSD), total uncertainty with 95{\%} confidence limits (U 95), and the newly introduced Combined Performance Index (CPI), which optimally combines two KS indices with RMSD. For direct irradiance, consistently high rankings are obtained with five models (REST2, Ineichen, Hoyt, Bird, and Iqbal-C, in decreasing order of performance) that require a relatively large number of atmospheric inputs. The inferior performance of models requiring little or no atmospheric inputs suggests that large-scale solar resource products derived from them may be inappropriate for serious solar applications. Additionally, prediction uncertainties under ideal clear-sky conditions can propagate and affect all-sky predictions as well-resulting in potential biases in existing solar resource maps at the continent scale, for instance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Renewable energy resources are variable by nature. Due to this fact conventional electricity systems, which were designed for centralized generation, have to follow a different management approach when a big share of these technologies take part into the system. The space-time variability characteristics of solar radiation, wind and precipitation are very different and a detailed understanding of them is important for an adequate planning and management of the electricity system. This paper is focused on solar irradiation as source of energy for photovoltaic (PV) generation, but the proposed scheme can generally be applied to other renewable resources and different solar irradiation applications. A comprehensive methodology to analyze variability and complementarity of solar resource and PV production among sub-regions of a wide area is developed. The photovoltaic energy yield is defined as kWh per kW installed, which facilitates the comparison among sub-regions and allows a comparison with other renewable energies like solar thermoelectric or wind energy. The multi-step approach facilitates the spatial evaluation and comparison among areas and it could be applied to different time resolutions, from a short term analysis to climatological perspective as well as a climate change projections analysis. The main steps of the method are the application of an objective clustering method for performing a regionalization of the whole domain, the ana lysis of the temporal variability of solar radiation and photovoltaic energy yield, and the intercomparison of the obtained clusters for examining their complementarity. As an implementation example, we make use of 30 years of daily satellite data, which is usually considered as the time for defining a climatology, and a long-term overview of solar variability is analyzed over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). In this region, the internal interconnections of the electrical system are strong, but the external interconnections are rather limited. The spatial distribution and variability of photovoltaic (PV) power yield is calculated for different tracking systems. The variability is analyzed on an interannual time scale, which is relevant for energy supply security and year-to-year price stability. The interannual variability shows robustness and stability of solar radiation and PV production on average for the whole domain, but with significant differences among clusters that could allow spatial compensation of PV production. The relationship between the variability of solar irradiation and of PV yield is not uniform among the different clusters. Areas where solar irradiation is higher are more sensitive to tracking type. The whole process described in the article provides the information of how solar resource and the PV energy yield perform in a limited area and provide the tools to analyze the relationships between sub-areas and their variability. In this sense, this method can be applied for isolated or nearly isolated electric systems located in regions with a variety of climates, or for interconnected systems involving several countries.},

abstract = {The energy produced by a photovoltaic system over a given period can be estimated from the incident radiation at the site where the Grid Connected PV System (GCPVS) is located, assuming knowledge of certain basic features of the system under study. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of solar radiation, the question "How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this location over the next few years?" involves an exercise of prediction inevitably subjected to a degree of uncertainty. Moreover, during the life cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: "Is the system working correctly?". This paper proposes and examines several methods to cope with these questions. The daily performance of a PV system is simulated. This simulation and the interannual variability of both radiation and productivity are statistically analyzed. From the results several regression adjustments are obtained. This analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity prediction and performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical analysis of the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method of malfunctioning parts of the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Martin2001,
abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) modules in real operation present angular losses in reference to their behaviour in standard test conditions, due to the angle of incidence of the incident radiation and the surface soil. Although these losses are not always negligible, they are commonly not taken into account when correcting the electrical characteristics of the PV module or estimating the energy production of PV systems. The main reason of this approximation is the lack of easy-to-use mathematical expressions for the angular losses calculation. This paper analyses these losses on PV modules and presents an analytical model based on theoretical and experimental results. The proposed model fits monocrystalline as well as polycrystalline and amorphous silicon PV modules, and contemplates the existence of superficial dust. With it angular losses integrated over time periods of interest can be easily calculated. Monthly and annual losses have been calculated for 10 different European sites, having diverse climates and latitudes (ranging from 32?? to 52??), and considering different module tilt angles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The statistics of hourly global radiation are analysed for various climates and locations, at time scales ranging from one month to one hour. The probabilistic and sequential properties of the hourly clearness index ktare related with a variety of parameters, including the daily clearness index Ktand the solar altitude angle h, thereby displaying the nonstationary and time-inhomogeneous nature of hourly radiation. Analytical expressions for the probability distribution of ktare proposed (truncated Gaussian functions depending on Ktand h). The results reported in this paper provide a deeper understanding of hourly solar radiation statistics, and explain some of the features displayed by radiation data at longer time scales. From the practical point of view they have implications, for example, for the construction of models for generating synthetic radiation data, an important and often indispensable tool for designing and simulating solar systems. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

For these determinations, it is necessary to have, either from actual measurements or estimates, a knowledge of the total (direct plus diffuse) radiation on a horizontal surface-its measurement is now regularly made at 98 localities in the United States and Canada. For localities where only an estimate of the long term average total radiation is available, relationships presented in this paper can be utilized to determine the statistical distribution of the daily total radiation at these localities.},

@article{Wild2005,
abstract = {Variations in solar radiation incident at Earth's surface profoundly affect the human and terrestrial environment. A decline in solar radiation at land surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from 1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Since the 1980s anthropogenic aerosols have been considerably reduced in Europe and the Mediterranean area. This decrease is often considered as the likely cause of the brightening effect observed over the same period. This phenomenon is however hardly reproduced by global and regional climate models. Here we use an original approach based on reanalysis-driven coupled regional climate system modelling, to show that aerosol changes explain 81 ± 16 per cent of the brightening and 23 ± 5 per cent of the surface warming simulated for the period 1980–2012 over Europe. The direct aerosol effect is found to dominate in the magnitude of the simulated brightening. The comparison between regional simulations and homogenized ground-based observations reveals that observed surface solar radiation, as well as land and sea surface temperature spatio-temporal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region are only reproduced when simulations include the realistic aerosol variations.},

abstract = {Ambitious climate change mitigation plans call for a significant increase in the use of renewables, which could, however, make the supply system more vulnerable to climate variability and changes. Here we evaluate climate change impacts on solar photovoltaic (PV) power in Europe using the recent EURO-CORDEX ensemble of high-resolution climate projections together with a PV power production model and assuming a well-developed European PV power fleet. Results indicate that the alteration of solar PV supply by the end of this century compared with the estimations made under current climate conditions should be in the range (-14{\%};+2{\%}), with the largest decreases in Northern countries. Temporal stability of power generation does not appear as strongly affected in future climate scenarios either, even showing a slight positive trend in Southern countries. Therefore, despite small decreases in production expected in some parts of Europe, climate change is unlikely to threaten the European PV sector.},
